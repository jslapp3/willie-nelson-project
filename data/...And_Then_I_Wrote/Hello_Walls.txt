Hello walls (hello, hello), how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

[Verse 2]
Hello window (hello, hello), well, I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain

[Bridge]
She went away and left us all alone, the way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can

[Verse 3]
Hello ceiling (hello, hello), I'm going to stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me a while?
We gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like2Embed
