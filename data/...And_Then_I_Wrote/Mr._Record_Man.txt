8 ContributorsMr. Record Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mr. Record Man, I'm lookin' for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing 'bout someone who went away
Just like me, his heart was yearnin' for a love that used to be
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Chorus]
There was something' 'bout a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man, get this record for me, won't you please?
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Verse 2]
I was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
And the man that I heard singin' sounded so blue and all alone
As I listened to his lonely song, I wondered, "Could it be?
Could there somewhere be another lonely man like me?"

[Chorus]
There was somethin' about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man, oh get this record for me, won't you please?
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
