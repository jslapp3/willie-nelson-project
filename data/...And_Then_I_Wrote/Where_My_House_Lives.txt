5 ContributorsWhere My House Lives Lyrics[Verse]
Stop here across the street to your right
That's where my house lives, sometimes I stayed there at night
But mostly I was on the move, business first, you know
And she'd wait there in her lonely room, but oh that's been so long ago

[Chorus]
She's gone now, she couldn't stand to be alone
And now it waits there, this house that used to be my home
I never go there 'cause it holds too many memories since she's gone
But right there is where my house lives all alone

[Chorus]
She's gone now, she couldn't stand to be alone
And now it waits there, this house that used to be my home
I never go there 'cause it holds too many memories since she's gone
But right there is where my house lives all aloneSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
