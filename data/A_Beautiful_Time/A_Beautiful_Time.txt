4 ContributorsA Beautiful Time Lyrics[Verse]
Drinkin' a black coffee
In a little motel lobby
Waitin' on the band to come down
I've been travelin' across Texas
In a little station wagon
Draggin' a trailer around

[Verse]
I do the drivin'
They do the drinkin'
That's how I keep us alive
Now, we played a good show
Last night in Waco
Well, we still got an eight hour drive

[Chorus]
If I ever get home
I'll still love the road
Still love the way that it winds
Now when the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time

[Instrumental]

Now we're packed up and rollin'
Who cares where we're goin'
The radio's playin' sweet country sounds
Got thе sun on my skin
My hair's in the wind
And all of the windows rolled down

[Chorus]
If I еver get home
I'll still love the road
Still love the way that it winds
When the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
They're havin' a party
In the back seat, oh Lordy
Looks like they're all out of beer
They're laughin' at a good jokes
Rollin' a good smoke
Why don't ya'll pass that one up here
[Chorus]
If I ever get home
I'll still love the road
I'll still love the way that it winds
When the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time
I sure had a beautiful time

[Instrumental]Embed
