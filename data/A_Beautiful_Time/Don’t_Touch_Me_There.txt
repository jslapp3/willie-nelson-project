6 ContributorsDon’t Touch Me There Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't touch me there
That's where my heart lives
Don't touch me there
It's way too soon
That it just ain't fair
To take advantage of a crazy fool
Just remember the golden rule
And, please, don't touch me there

[Chorus]
Don't get too close
Don't play that game
And if we pass on the streets
Don't call my name
Don't touch me there
That's where my heart lives
And it just ain't fair, and if you care
Don't touch me there

[Verse 2]
Don't touch me therе
'Cause I've forgotten
And I oncе loved you
And I don't care
That it just ain't fair
To try to kindle up a fire grown cold
There's nothing here to hold
So, please, don't touch me there

Don't get too close
Don't play that game
And if we pass on the streets
Don't call my name
Don't touch me there
That's where my heart lives
And it just ain't fair, and if you care
Don't touch me there

[Outro]
It just ain't fair, and if you care
Don't touch me thereEmbed
