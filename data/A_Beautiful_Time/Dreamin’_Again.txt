4 ContributorsDreaminâ€™ Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I turned in my bed and found myself reaching for you
Frost on the window and the warmth of the love we once knew
I reached out to hold you and feel your breath on my skin
But then I woke up and I knew you, I have been dreamin' again

[Chorus]
What's the dream to dreamer?
The ghosts are the love is all gone
What's the song to the singer?
When the last of the crowd has gone home
What's a gift to the giver?
But there's nobody there to receive
What's faith to a lover?
When there's nothing left to believe

[Verse 2]
I remember the morning, i first woke up to the your smile
With your face like an angel and your body so reckless and wild
The day we were married we promised our love will never end
But you were just crazy, and I was just dreamin' again

[Chorus]
What's the dream to dreamer?
The ghosts are the love is all gone
What's the song to the singer?
When the last of the crowd has gone home
What's a gift to the giver?
But there's nobody there to receive
What's faith to a lover?
There's nothing left to believe
