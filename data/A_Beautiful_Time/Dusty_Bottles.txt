5 ContributorsDusty Bottles Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's something to be said for gettin' older
Dusty bottles pour a finer glass of wine
An old beat-up guitar just sounds better
And wisdom only comes with time
I can spot mistakes before they happen
Separate the BS from the truth
I'm learnin' when I need to keep my mouth shut
Like I couldn't in my wild and wasted youth

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong
It's good bein' young
But there's somethin' to be said for getting wrinkles
Every song worth singin's got those lines
And there's nothin' you can do, it's gonna happen
Sit down and drink a beer with fathеr time

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong
I miss bеin' young
But there's somethin' to be said for getting older
And agin' seems to mellow out the mind
Memories are made to sip and savour
And dusty bottles pour a finer glass of wineSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
