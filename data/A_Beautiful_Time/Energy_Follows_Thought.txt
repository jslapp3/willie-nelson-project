5 ContributorsEnergy Follows Thought Lyrics[Verse 1]
Imagine what you want
Then get out of the way
Remember energy follows thought
So be careful what you say
Be careful what you ask for
Make sure it's really what you want
Because your mind is made for thinking
And energy follows thought

[Chorus]
Your mind is in control
Even when you do not know
And if you let it idle
Ain't no telling where it'll go

[Verse 2]
Wherever you are sleeping
And your dreams take you away
Go on with your dreaming
And listen to what they say
And if you hear spirits talking
Their wisdom can't be bought
Apply it to your thinking
And energy follows thought

Your mind is in control
Evеn when you do not know
And if you let it idle
Ain't no tеlling where it'll go

[Outro]
Imagine what you want
And get out of the way
Remember energy follows thought
So be careful what you sayEmbed
