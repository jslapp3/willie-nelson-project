I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine
I'll be somewhere lookin' back at loved ones left behind
My life has been a wonder and I found my place in time
But I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine

[Verse 2]
I'll be somewhere singin' songs with all those friends of mine
Life is great, but I can't wait to make our memories rhyme
Now those who've gone before me will save my place in line
I don't go to funerals, I won't be at minе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
There'll be a big ol' pickin' party whеn it comes my time
Me and Waylon, John and Chris and our sweetheart Patsy Cline
Merle and Grady and Freddy Powers, all those pals of mine
But I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine

[Verse 4]
Somewhere, I hear angel voices singin' in the wind
Sayin' how it won't be long 'til time to fly again
Life is sweet and love is good and we have had a good time
But I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine
No, I don't go to funerals, I sure won't be at mineSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
