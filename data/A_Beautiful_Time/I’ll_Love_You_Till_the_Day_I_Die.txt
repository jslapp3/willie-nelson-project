5 ContributorsI’ll Love You Till the Day I Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
I only saw you once
And that was a long, long time ago
You probably don't remember me
But I thought I'd let you know
That one short conversation
Is still the reason why
I'll love you 'til the day I die

[Verse 2]
You knew I was an honest man
I guess I knew it too
But if I'd known then what I know now
I'd trade it all for you
And when you turned and walked away
I didn't bat an eye
But I'll love you 'til the day I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I didn't know my heart back then
What was there to know?
If I could do it all again
I'd never let you go
Twenty minutes, twenty years ago
Is still the reason why
I'll love you 'til thе day I die

In case I still might sleep with you
In some sweet by-and-by
I'm gonna lovе you 'til the day I die
I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die1Embed
