5 ContributorsLeave You With A Smile Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could make my time with you stand still
There'd be no time that I would wanna kill
I'd drink in every drop of you and never get my fill
If I could make my time with you stand still

[Verse 2]
Or if I could make your every dream come true
I'd grant every wish I could for you
Darlin', for your love, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If I can make your every dream come true

[Pre-Chorus]
And my love, my love is true
And you know me, I'd never lie to you
And if I, if I run out of time
I'll wait for you in the sweet by-and-by

[Chorus]
I just wanna leave you with a smile
Even though that hasn't always been my style
I messed up best intentions, but I've loved you all the while
I just wanna leave you with a smile

Even though that hasn't always been my style

I just wanna leave you with a smile
