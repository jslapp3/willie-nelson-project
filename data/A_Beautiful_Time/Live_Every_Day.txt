5 ContributorsLive Every Day LyricsLive every day like it was your last one
And one day you're gonna be right
Treat every one like you wanna be treated
See how that changes your life

Yesterday is dead and tomorrow is blind
And the future is way out of sight
Live every day like it was your last one
And one day you're gonna be right

If there someone you love
You haven't told them
You wanna tell them today
If there someone you've wrong

And you've not said I'm sorry
It might be a good thing to say
Pick up the phone and send them a message
It's time to make everything right
Live every day like it was your last one
One day you're gonna be right

Live every day like it was your last one
And one day you're gonna be right
Treat every one like you wanna be treated
See how that changes your life
