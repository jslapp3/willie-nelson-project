7 ContributorsMe And My Partner Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me and my partner, my only best friend
Here for the moment and then gone with the wind
Tellin' a tale every now and again
About things that we've done and the places we've been

[Chorus]
Hangin' on to promises and key chains that rust
And old broken hearts that a body can't trust
Ridin' and reapin' the road as we go
Me and my partner, look out, Mexico

[Verse 2]
Me and my partner, that's all that I've got
To help me survive, what I am and am not
Some days were too long and some nights wеre too hot
But we did what we donе and forgave and forgot

[Chorus]
Still hangin' on to promises and key chains that rust
Old broken hearts that a body can't trust
Ridin' and reapin' the road as we go
Me and my partner, look out, Mexico
Me and my partner, hello, MexicoSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
