My heart was a dancer
No, you don't need to know her name
She could turn right on a nickel
And give you back four cents in change
My heart was a dancer
She made her livin' on her toes
And what she ever saw in me
Only God and Heaven knows

[Chorus]
I used to sit at my table
Just me and whiskey all alone
Watchin' my heart dance
And each night, I'd try to take her home
Others would try to show my heart
A better way to feel
My heart was a dancer
Oh, heart, please just don't bе still

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My heart was a dancer
I'd love to see hеr dancin' now
Pretty and graceful
Still beatin' just for me somehow
My heart was a dancer
Another lifetime ago
She was real for me
But for the others, it was all just a show

I used to sit at my table
Just me and whiskey all alone
Watchin' my heart dance
And each night, I'd try to take her home
Others would try to show my heart
A better way to feel
My heart was a dancer
Oh, heart, please don't be still
My heart was a dancer
Oh, heart, please don't be stillEmbed
