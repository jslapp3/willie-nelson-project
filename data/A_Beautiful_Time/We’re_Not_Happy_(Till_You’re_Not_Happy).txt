5 ContributorsWe’re Not Happy (Till You’re Not Happy) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's play a little old fashioned texas, hold'em
Shuffle them up and ante up, my friend
Smoke up if you gotta or let's roll, so
Fire them up and pass them around again
Best beware of pickpockets and loose women
Because they're known to frequent jangles orchid lounge
Don't go betting it all on that old river
If you're into deep, it's bound to pull you down

[Chorus]
We're not happy til you're not happy
Here comes old money bags again
We're not happy til you're not happy
But we're glad to let you buy back in my friend

[Verse 2]
Stanton, he don't care about the money
He just comes for what his jokes and all his lives
We're here to shoot the bull and shoot tequila
Replace some cards and hide out from our wives
The stakes ain't the only thing that's getting high
I can see the party's getting in your eyes
Odds are you won't get to rake it in
Because it's gonna take a dead man's hand to win

We're not happy til, you're not happy
Here comes old money bags again
We're not happy til, you're not happy
But we're glad to let you buy back in my friend

[Chorus]
We're not happy til, you're not happy
Here comes old money bags again
We're not happy til, you're not happy
But we'll gladly let you buy back in my friend
We'll gladly let you buy back in my friendEmbed
