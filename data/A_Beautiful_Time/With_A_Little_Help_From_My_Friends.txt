7 ContributorsWith A Little Help From My Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus]
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Refrain]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it bе anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Chorus]
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Refrain]
Do you need anybody?
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Chorus]
I get by with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I get by with a little help from my friendsEmbed
