2 Contributors(The) Most Unoriginal Sin Lyrics[Verse]
What there was left of us
Was all covered in dust and thick skin
A half-eaten apple
Or the whole Sistine Chapel
Painted on the head of a pin
A lifelong love's work
Gone up in a smirk
And you didn't even see her waltz in
Now this love is a ghost
For having played host
To the most unoriginal sin
At the wedding we smiled
As some devil played wild violin
Soon after the chapel
She offered me that apple
One bite and I was gone with the wind
And you needed no proof
Because the whole naked truth
Was wearing only an infidel's grin
And a proud schoolboy's boast
For having left his post
For the most unoriginal sin
Now the jukebox is humming
All the venal shortcomings of men
But I found me this drink
That can finally sink
All this guilt that I've been wallowing in
Buddy, once you get started
Once true love's departed
You do it over and over again
So tonight I will toast
Just whoever comes close
To the most unoriginal sin
So tonight I will toast
Just whoever comes close
To the most unoriginal sinSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
