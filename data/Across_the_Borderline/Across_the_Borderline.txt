3 ContributorsAcross the Borderline Lyrics[Verse]
There's a land where I've been told
Every street is paved with gold
And it's just across the borderline
When it's time to take your turn
Here's a lesson that you must learn
You can lose more than you'll ever find
When you reach the broken promise land
Every dream slips through your hand
You'll know it's too late to change your mind
Because you paid the price to come to far
Just to wind up where you are
And you're still just across the borderline
Up and down the Rio Grande
A thousand footprints in the sand
Reveal the secret no one can define
The river flows on like a breath
In between our life and death
Who's the next to cross the borderline
Hope remains when pride is gone
And it keeps you moving on
Calling you across the borderline
And you're still just across the borderlineSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
