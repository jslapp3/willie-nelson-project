5 ContributorsAmerican Tune Lyrics[Verse 1]
Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I'm alright, I'm alright
Just weary to my bones
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
So far away from home
So far away from home

[Verse 2]
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
Don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees
Oh, but it's alright, it's alright
For we've lived so well so long
Still when I think of the road we're travelin' on
I wonder what's gone wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong

[Verse 3]
And I dreamed I was dying
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
Looking back down at me, smiled reassuredly
I dreamed I was flying
High up above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying

We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
Come on the ship that sails the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hours
And sing an American tune
Oh, but it's alright, it's alright
Can't be forever blessed
Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day
And I try to get some rest
That's all I'm trying, to get some rest
