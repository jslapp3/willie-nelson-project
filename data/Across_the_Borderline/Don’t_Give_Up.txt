4 ContributorsDonâ€™t Give Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left, or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

[Chorus]
Don't give up, because you have friends
Don't give up, you're not beaten yet
Don't give up, I know you can make it good

[Verse 2]
Though I saw it all around
I never thought that I could be affected
I thought that we would be the last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born on the lakeside
And as daylight broke I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

[Chorus]
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up, we don't need much of anything
Don't give up, because somewhere there's a place
There's a place where we belong

Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
I'm going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing [x2]
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job so many men
So many men no one needs

[Chorus]
Don't give up, because you have friends
Don't give up, you're not the only one
Don't give up, no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up, because I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belongEmbed
