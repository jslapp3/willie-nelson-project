3 ContributorsGetting Over You Lyrics[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
Why do I still write?
Why do I still call?
Why do I still think?
There's hope for us at all
These are the things I hate
But they're the things I do
To get over you

[Verse 2: Bonnie Raitt]
Sunsets make me cry
Old pictures make me grin
But I don't really care
To see your face again
These are the things I say
But they're so hard to do
Like gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus: Willie Nelson & Bonnie Raitt]
You gotta believe that there's a reason
That we surrender up our hearts
But there's a vantage point
And it takes some time to find
Where you can see how all the pieces fit
As you watch 'em fall apart

Now I don't think it's right
And you don't know what's wrong
My heart keeps asking me
Just where do we belong
It's not as though my life
Ain't hard enough to do
Try gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus: Willie Nelson & Bonnie Raitt]
You gotta believe that there's a reason
That we surrender up our hearts
But there's a vantage point
And it takes some time to find
Where you can see how all the pieces fit
As you watch 'em fall apart

[Chorus 2: Willie Nelson & Bonnie Raitt, Both]
And other people say
Stop living in the past
But when there's nothing left
It's your memory that lasts
It's later than you think
But still this isn't through
This gettin' over you
Now it's later than you think
And still this isn't through
This gettin' over youEmbed
