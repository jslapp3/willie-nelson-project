3 ContributorsI Love the Life I Live Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you watching me just like a hawk
I don't mind the way you talk
But if you touch me something's got to give
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
My diamond ring and my money too
Tomorrow night they could belong to you
The girl move me at their will
I live the life I love and I love the life I live
I may lay a hundred on a bet this time
Tomorrow night can't cover your dime
Next week I could be over the hill
I'm just trying to tell you people how I feel

[Chorus]
You see me rocking as I pass you by
Don't talk about me cause I could be high
Just forgive me if you will
I live the life I love and I love the life I live

[Verse 2]
Well, I may lay a hundred on a bet this time
Tomorrow night can't cover your dime
Next week I could be over the hill
I'm just trying to tell you people how I feel
