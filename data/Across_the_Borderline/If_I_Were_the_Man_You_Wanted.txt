3 ContributorsIf I Were the Man You Wanted LyricsThey all sat around in a circle laughing and all telling lies
Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar he said boys I've got nothing to hide
The King and the Queen stood together then the ace he would not be to blame
And if the cards were all laid on the table then love could be more than a game
And if the stars didn't shine on the water then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am

And I have seen my share of long nights and I have told my share of lies
And I have run into the darkness when I saw the look in your eyes
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness then the daylight would be hard to find
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness I would have never have spoken my mind
And if the stars didn't shine on the water

So if you're going out to Carolina then don't linger in New Mexico
And if you think of the one there behind you then you might not feel so alone
And if the stars didn't shine on the water
And if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I amSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
