2 ContributorsSheâ€™s Not for You (1993) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pay no mind to her she only wants to play
But she's not for you, she's not for you
And I'm the only one who would let her act this way

[Refrain]
But she's not for you, she's not for you

[Verse 2]
So she told you she found heaven in your eyes
Well I think it only fair to warn you that sometimes she lies
But it's your heart I can't tell you what to do

[Refrain]
But she's not for you, she's not for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
She just looks for greener pastures now and then
And when she grows tired she knows Old Faithful will just take her back again
So just leave her here I'm used to feeling blue

[Refrain]
But she's not for you, she's not for you
She's not for you, she's not for youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
