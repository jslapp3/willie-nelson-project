Still is still moving to me
I swim like a fish in the sea all the time
But if that's what it takes to be free, I don't mind
Still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

[Chorus]
And it's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words, but I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

[Refrain]
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la

[Chorus]
It's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words, but I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

Still is still moving to me
