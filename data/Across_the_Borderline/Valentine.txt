Valentine won't you be my Valentine
And introduce your heart to mine and be my Valentine
Summertime we could run and play like summertime
With storybooks and nursery rhymes so be my Valentine

[Chorus][x2]
Candy heart if anyone could you could have a candy heart
You're the sweetest of all sweethearts won't you give your heart to me
Can't you see
I love you valentine won't you be my Valentine
And won't you share your space with mine and be my ValentineSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
