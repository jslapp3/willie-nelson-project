And the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink

That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Were leaving for the coast
Although both my eyes were wide-open
They might just just have well been closed

Well she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died
And so it wasEmbed
