3 ContributorsDo Right Woman, Do Right Man Lyrics[Verse]
Take her to heart
And she'll always love you
And nobody can make her do wrong
But take her for granted
Leaving your love un-shown
Makes will power weak
And temptation strong
A woman's only human

[Chorus]
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood
Just like her man
And if you want
A do right all day's woman
You got to be
A do right all night's man

[Chorus]
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood
Just like her man
And if you want
A do right all day's woman
You got to be
A do right all night's manSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
