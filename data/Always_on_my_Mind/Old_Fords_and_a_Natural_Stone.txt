3 ContributorsOld Fords and a Natural Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Papa's words ringing in my ears
Son you got to get tighter with your tears
Just because she's leaving don't start believing
That your rock-n-roll days are gone
'Cause nothing lasts forever but old Fords and a natural stone

[Verse 2]
And when those sad songs and slow hurting songs
Get you down while you're alone it won't hurt long
'Cause nothing lasts forever like old Fords and a natural stone

[Verse 3]
Diamonds are forever and these old cars they still keep rollin' on
And all those "I love you forever's" they're just words that can't be depended on
Because when they're wrong, they're wrong
And when they're gone, they're gone
'Cause nothing lasts forever but old Fords or a natural stone

[Outro]
Papa's words ringing in my ears
