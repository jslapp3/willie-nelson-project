4 ContributorsStaring Each Other Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're hanging on his arm
She's holding mine
A fool must have said love was blind
We're shouting I love you's
With people all around
And they don't hear one sound

[Chorus]
Let her eyes do the talking
And her eyes do the walking
And her eyes do the slipping
Around staring each other down

[Verse 2]
And we're both on to
How long a slow song
Would be for us now
This timebomb we're holding
Is so near exploding right down

[Chorus]
So let her eyes do the talking
And eyes do the walking
Her eyes do the slipping
Around staring each other down
