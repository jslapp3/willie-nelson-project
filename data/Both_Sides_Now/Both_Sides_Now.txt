3 ContributorsBoth Sides Now Lyrics[Intro]
Bows and flows of angel hair
Ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere
I'd look at clouds that way

[Verse 1]
Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I could have done
The clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know cloud at all

[Verse 2]
Moons and Junes and Ferris Wheels
Dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale complete
I'd look at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
