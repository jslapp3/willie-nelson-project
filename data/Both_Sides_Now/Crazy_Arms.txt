5 ContributorsCrazy Arms Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
And you're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

[steel]

[Verse 2]
So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to[?]
And that's why I'm lonely all the timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
