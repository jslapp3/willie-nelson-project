Everybody's talking about me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes in my mind
Everybody stops to staring
I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

[Verse]
I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the falling rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off the northeast wind
And sailing on summer breeze
Skipping over the ocean like a stone

[guitar]

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking about me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
Everybody stops to staring
I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I won't let you leave my love behind[x3]See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
