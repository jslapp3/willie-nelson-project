2 ContributorsIt Could Be Said That Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we look into each other's eyes
Our hearts aren't beating wildly as they beat before
And when we hold each other in our arms
We can't receive the same vibrations anymore
And when we hear each other speak our names
We don't hear the ringing and the singing of a million bells
Perhaps our hearing's failing us perhaps we're hearing other things but who can tell

[Chorus]
It could be said that way it could be said that way
But I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
What's the point in making leaving any harder than a leaving really ought to be

[Verse 2]
And this road on which I travel paved with broken glass and gravel
Has just room for me I hope there's room for me
I suspect that I'll be lonely but I know that if I'm lonely I'll deserve to be
And I plan to think about you just as often as I will and that's my plans for me

[Chorus]
It could be said that way it could be said that way
But I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
What's the use in making rhymes I'd much rather say it's time for me to goSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like2Embed
