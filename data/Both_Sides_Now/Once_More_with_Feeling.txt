5 ContributorsOnce More with Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once more with feeling once more with feeling
Won't you hold me till the night fades into day
Once more with feeling once more with feeling
Hold me close don't let this feeling go away

[Verse 2]
Sometimes myself runs back to you
I just can't tell me what to do
But I remember when all wrapped up tight within
The shelter of my arms you used to stay
Once more with feeling
Once more with feelingSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
