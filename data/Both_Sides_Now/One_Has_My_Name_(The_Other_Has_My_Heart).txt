2 ContributorsOne Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart) Lyrics[Verse]
One has my name and the other has my heart
With one I'll remain
That's when my heartaches start
One has brown eyes and the other's eyes're blue
To one I am tied
To the other I am true

[Chorus]
One has my love and the other only me
But what good is love
To a heart that can't be free
So I'll go on living
My life's just the same
While one has my heart and the other has my name

[steel - guitar]
