4 ContributorsPins and Needles (In My Heart) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I'm here without you
I've got Pins And Needles in my heart

[Verse 2]
The days and night are growing longer
Since first you said that we must part
I only know I can't forget you
With these Pins And Needles in my heartSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
