2 ContributorsWabash Cannonball Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the great Atlantic ocean
To the wide Pacific shore
To the queen of flowing mountains
For the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome
And she's known quite well by all
She came down from Birmingham

[Chorus]
On the Wabash Cannonball
Well now listen to the jingle
To the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland
Through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine
And the lonesome hoboes call
No changes can be taken
On the Wabash Cannonball

[steel]

[Verse 2]
Now here's to daddy Claxton
May his name forever stand
He'll always be remembered
In the ports throughout the land
His earthly race is over
And the curtain round him falls
We'll carry him home to Glory
