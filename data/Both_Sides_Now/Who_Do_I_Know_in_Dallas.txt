5 ContributorsWho Do I Know in Dallas Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who do I know in Dallas who can I call on the phone
Who do I know in Dallas that will help me forget she's gone
Shirley consoled me in Phoenix and Jeannie in old San Antone
But who do I know in Dallas that will help me forget that I'm alone

[steel]

[Verse 2]
I can't spend the night without someone the lonelies will drive me insane
So who do I know in Dallas that will make me be happy I came
Who do I know in Dallas that will make me be happy I cameSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
