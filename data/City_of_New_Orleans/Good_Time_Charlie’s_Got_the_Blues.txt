Everybody's gone away
Said they're moving to LA
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leaving town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town will waste your time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine

[Chorus]
Some got to win, some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Some got to win, some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues

[Verse 2]
You know my heart keeps telling me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
You play around, you lose your wife
You play too long, you lose your life
I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
But everybody's leaving town

Some got to win, some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Some got to win, some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the bluesEmbed
