3 ContributorsIt Turns Me Inside Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a way I'm glad it's over
Even though it's going to hurt me once you're gone
But I can learn to live without you
Give me time and I can make it on my own

[Chorus]
Loving you to me came easy
And losing you will change my life no doubt
In a way I'm glad it's over
But another way it turns me inside out

[Verse 2]
In a way I guess it's better
Even though there's nothing good about goodbye
But I know I couldn't hold you
Now you found your wings and you need room to fly

[Chorus]
Loving you to me came easy
And losing you will change my life no doubt
In a way I'm glad it's over
But another way it turns me inside out

[Verse 3]
On the one hand I know I'll be better off once you're gone
But I find a lot of heartaches on the other
And I can't say that I look forward to those nights I'll be alone
And I wonder if there'll ever be another

Loving you to me came easy
And losing you will change my life no doubt
In a way I'm glad it's over
But another way it turns me inside out

[Outro]
In a way I'm glad it's over
In another way it turns me inside outEmbed
