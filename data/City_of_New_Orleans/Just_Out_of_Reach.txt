4 ContributorsJust Out of Reach Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love that runs away from my dreams
That just won't let me be
Blues that keep on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

[Chorus]
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

[Verse 2]
Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories time cannot erase
Then I awake and find you're gone and I'm so blue and all alone

[Chorus]
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

[Bridge]
That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

[Chorus]
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty armsSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
