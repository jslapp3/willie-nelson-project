5 ContributorsPlease Come to Boston Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm staying here with some friends and they've got lots of room
And you can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be working soon
Please come to Boston, but she said, "No, would you come home to me?"

[Chorus]
And she said, "Rambling boy, why don't you settle down?
Boston isn't your kind of town
There's no gold and there's nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee"

[Verse 2]
Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far we can't be found
And throw, "I love you" echoes down the Canyon
And then lie awake at night until they come back around
Please come to Denver, she said, "No, would you come home to me?"

[Chorus]
And she said, "Rambling boy, why don't you settle down?
Boston isn't your kind of town
There's no gold and there's nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee"

Now this drifter's world goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever going to stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found and all that I haven't got
I still need to lean to somebody I can sing to

[Verse 3]
Please come to L.A. to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky, living up on the hill
Please come to L.A., but she said, "No, would you come home to me?"

[Chorus]
And she said, "Rambling boy, why don't you settle down?
Boston isn't your kind of town
There's no gold and there's nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee"Embed
