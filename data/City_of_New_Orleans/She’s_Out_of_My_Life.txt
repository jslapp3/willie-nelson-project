She's out of my life, she's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life

[Verse]
It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands, she's out of my hands
I have learned love is not possession
And I have learned that love won't wait
I have learned love needs expression
But I learned it too late

[Chorus]
She's out of my life, she's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my lifeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
