4 ContributorsUntil Itâ€™s Time for You to Go Lyrics[Chorus 1]
You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman
I'm not a king, I'm a man, take my hand
We'll make a space in the lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go

[Verse 1]
Yes, we're different, worlds apart, we're not the same
We laughed and played at the stars like in a game
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go

[Chorus 2]
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Love me now

[Verse 2]
This love of mine had no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak, now I'm a willow, now I can bend
And though I'll never in my life see you again
Still I'll stay until it's time for you to go

[Chorus 2]
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Love me now
