4 ContributorsWhy Are You Pickinâ€™ on Me Lyrics[Verse]
You could have your choice of guys at town
Why are you picking on me?
Just snap your fingers and they'll come around
Why are you picking on me?
I'm well aware of this game you've learned
To love and then leave and show no concern
And tomorrow you'll have other candles to burn
So why are you picking on me?

[Piano & Guitar]

[Outro]
You could have your choice
