4 ContributorsWind Beneath My Wings Lyrics[Verse]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You've been content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind
I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain
Did you ever know that you're my hero and everything I'd like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
But you are the wind beneath my wings

[Outro]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
I would be nothing without you I miss everything about you
Did you ever know
You are the wind beneath my wingsSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
