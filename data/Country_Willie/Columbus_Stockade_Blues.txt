Way down in Columbus, Georgia
I want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends have turned their backs on me

[Verse 2]
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart, you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

[Verse 1]
Way down in Columbus, Georgia
I want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends have turned their backs on me

[Verse 2]
Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart, you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind
