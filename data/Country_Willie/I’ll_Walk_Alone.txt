2 ContributorsIâ€™ll Walk Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll walk alone
Where once we wandered
It seems so strange
Since you are gone
'Til you return
I'll stay the same, dear
But while you're gone
I'll walk alone

[Verse 2]
By stars above
I swear to love you
With all the love
ThatI've ever known
No mater where you are out yonder
I'll still be true
And walk alone
I'll still be true
And walk aloneSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
