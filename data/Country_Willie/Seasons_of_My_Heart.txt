5 ContributorsSeasons of My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
The seasons come, the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain, and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there are no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
And my love for you will bloom eternally

[Chorus]
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all

[Chorus]
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all
And darling, we could be happy after allSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
