2 ContributorsTake Me as I Am (Or Let Me Go) LyricsWhy must you always try to make me over
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of the one you used to know
But I won't be a stand in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

You tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you can't overlook my faults forget me
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of the one you used to know
But I won't be a stand in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me goSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
