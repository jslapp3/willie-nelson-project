3 ContributorsThere Goes a Man Lyrics[Chorus]
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone
And I feel sorry for him
For that someone just gave her heart to me

[Verse 1]
Now he's the loser and it hurts so much to lose and I feel sorry for him
'Cause the loser I know could have been me

[Verse 2]
Oh how he loved her I'm sure he must have loved her almost as much as me
But fate has frowned on him then turned around and smiled on me

[Chorus]
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone
And I feel sorry for him
For that someone just gave her heart to me

[Verse 3]
If things were different and if he had won her love instead of me
I wonder if he'd find the time to offer sympathy

[Chorus]
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone
And I feel sorry for him
'Cause that someone just gave her heart to meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
