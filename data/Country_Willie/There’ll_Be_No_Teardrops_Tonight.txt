1 ContributorThereâ€™ll Be No Teardrops Tonight Lyrics[Intro]
(There will be no teardrops tonight)

[Verse 1]
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
And I make believe that wrong is right
Your wedding day will be tomorrow

[Refrain]
But there ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight

[Verse 2]
And I'll believe that you still love me
When you wear your veil of white
But if you think that you're above me

[Refrain]
There ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight

[Verse 3]
(Shame oh shame) Shame oh shame for what you're doing
(Others arms) Others arms will hold you tight
And you don't care whose life you ruin

[Refrain]
But there ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight
And there'll be no teardrops tonightSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
