7 ContributorsAre You Sure Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look around you
Look down the bar from you
The lonely faces that you see
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

[Verse 2]
These are your friends
But are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

[Bridge]
Please don't let my tears persuade you
I had hoped I wouldn't cry
But lately, teardrops seem a part of me

[Verse 3]
So look around you
And take a good look
And just between you and me
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
