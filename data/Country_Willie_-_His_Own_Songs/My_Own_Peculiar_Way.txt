5 ContributorsMy Own Peculiar Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
It would be a comfort to know you'd never doubt me
Even though I give you cause most every day
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me
Although I love you in my own peculiar way

[Verse 2]
Don't doubt my love, if sometimes my mind should wander
To a suddenly remembered yesterday
My mind could never stay too long away from you
Because I love you in my own peculiar way

[Verse 3]
And though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
Though my faults may grow in number day by day
Let no one ever say I've ever been untrue
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
I'll always love you in my own peculiar waySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
