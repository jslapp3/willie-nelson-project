4 ContributorsOne Day at a Time Lyrics[Chorus]
I live one day at a time
I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
And I live one day at a time

[Verse 1]
Guess that's your surprise to see me back at home
But you know how much I miss you when I'm gone
Don't ask how long I planned to stay, it never it crossed my mind
I live one day at a time

[Verse 2]
See that sparrow fly across the cloudy sky
Searching for a patch of sunlight, so am I
Wish I didn't have to follow and perhaps I won't in time
I live one day at a time

[Chorus]
I live one day at a time
I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
And I live one day at a time
I live one day at a timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
