6 ContributorsSo Much to Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
My oatmeal tastes just like confetti
The coffee's too strong, so forget it
The toast is burning, well let it
There's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone

[Verse 2]
My tie is lost, I can't find my sweater
There's the doorbell, I hope that's your letter
My head aches, I hope I feel better
There's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone

[Chorus]
So much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone
And time, time rolls on like a river
And oh there's so much to do
And I just can't do without youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
