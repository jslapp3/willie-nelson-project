2 ContributorsWithin Your Crowd Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you remember how they warned you once before?
They made it clear you weren't to see me anymore
Within your world of riches, poor boys aren't allowed
And you must learn to love someone within your crowd

[Verse 2]
And though I love you more than I could ever say
The danger's much too great and you can't stay
You could never stand dishonor, you're too proud
So you must learn to love someone within your crowd

[Verse 3]
Someday you'll find someone deserving of your love
Someone to kiss the lips that I'm not worthy of
And when I see you passing by, I'll feel so proud
Although I stand outside, my heart's within your crowdSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
