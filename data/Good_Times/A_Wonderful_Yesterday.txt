3 ContributorsA Wonderful Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday
One on which I know that I can look back and smile
And with you here with me, the hours have flown away
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday

[Verse 2]
Today we have made a thousand and one memories
That we can recall when today is a sweet used-to-be
And with you in my arms, the future seems so far away
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterdaySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
