3 ContributorsAshamed Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so ashamed of my eyes 'cause they still cry for you
After they both watched my hand wave goodbye to you
I've told them time and time again that this will never do
And I've told them how you always laughed at teardrops

[Verse 2]
I'm so ashamed of my arms for missing you
Last night I woke up just in time to see them reach for you
And now my heart confesses it still wants you too
I'm so ashamed of them all for loving you

[Outro]
And now my heart confesses it still wants you too
I'm so ashamed of them all for loving youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
