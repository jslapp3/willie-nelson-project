4 ContributorsDecember Day Lyrics[Chorus]
This looks like a December day
This looks like a time to remember day

[Verse 1]
And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college
Where the green leaves of knowledge
Were waiting to fall with the Fall

[Verse 2]
And where September wine
Numbed the measure of time
Through the tears of October, now November's over
And this looks like a December day

[Chorus]
This looks like a December day
It looks like we've come to the end of the way

[Verse 3]
And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away
