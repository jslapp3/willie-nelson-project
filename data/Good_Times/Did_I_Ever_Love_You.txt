3 ContributorsDid I Ever Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did I ever ever love you?
Did I ever really care?
All the times that I cried for you
Did I really want you there?

[Chorus]
Wiser men than I have wondered
About love and never knew
And if I ever loved you
I guess I still do

[Verse 2]
All the nights that I spent crying
All those lonely lonesome times
Was it my imagination?
Was it only in my mind?

[Chorus]
Wiser men than I have wondered
About love and never knew
And if I ever loved you
I guess I still do

[Verse 3]
Is it here today and gone tomorrow?
This love that no one can explain
Can it begin a thing of beauty?
Then undergo a dreadful change

Wiser men than I have wondered
About love and never knew
And if I ever loved you
I guess I still doEmbed
