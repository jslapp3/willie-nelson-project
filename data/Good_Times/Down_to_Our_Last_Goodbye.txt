5 ContributorsDown to Our Last Goodbye Lyrics[Verse]
This was my last mistake
That's all her heart could take
Now we're down to our last goodbye

[Verse]
Her lips won't kiss me now
The lips that I taught how
Now we're down to our last goodbye

[Bridge]
What can I tell her that I haven't told her
That would change her mind?
'Cause she's heard that line before

[Verse]
Now all that's left for me is just the memory
Of all those happy days gone by
Now we're down to our last goodbye

[Bridge]
What can I tell her that I haven't told her
That would change her mind?
'Cause she's heard that line before

[Verse]
Now all that's left for me is just the memory
Of all those happy days gone by
Now we're down to our last goodbye
Now we're down to our last goodbyeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
