5 ContributorsGood Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I ran to the store with a penny
And when youth was abundant and plenty
Classify these as good times
Good times

[Verse 2]
When I rolled rubber tires in the driveway
Pulled a purse on a string across the highway
Classify these as good times
Good times

[Chorus]
Good times are coming, humming mmm
Good times are coming, humming mmm

[Verse 3]
Go to school, fight a war, working steady
Meet a girl, fall in love before I'm ready
Classify these as good times
Good times

[Verse 4]
Here I sit with a drink and a memory
But I'm not cold, I'm not wet, and I'm not hungry
So classify these as good times
Good times

Good times are coming, humming mmm
