6 ContributorsLittle Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hope I won't disturb you with this call
I'm just in town for such a little while
And I thought perhaps you'd like to hear the news
Jeannie's grades were the highest in the school
Billy sure does look a lot like you
I understand your other son does too

[Refrain]
And Billy said, "Tell Mom I miss her so"
These were some little things I thought you'd like to know

[Verse 2]
Remember Sam and Peg who lived next door
With them it seemed we always laughed so much
Well Sam and Peg don't live there anymore
I understand they broke up just like us
The house we lived in now has been torn down
Of all the things we owned, the last to go

[Refrain]
A freeway now runs through that part of town
These were some little things that I thought you'd like to know

[Outro]
These were some little things that I thought you'd like to knowSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
