2 ContributorsPages Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last evening, I turned back the pages of time
And tore out the chapters when you were mine
I attempted to cut out the memories of you
And paste in some new ones, far better and true
True

[Verse 2]
I searched through the chapters referring to hearts
For the one with the caption, "Till death do us part"
I ripped at each letter and I tore at each word
I screamed at your memory and nobody heard
Nobody heard

[Verse 3]
But your memory's determined and chances are few
Of my ever finding a replacement for you
It desperately clings to the floor of my mind
And fights for its place in the pages of timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
