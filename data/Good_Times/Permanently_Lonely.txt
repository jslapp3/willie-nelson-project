3 ContributorsPermanently Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't be concerned, it's time I learned
That those who play with fire get burned
But I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely

[Verse 2]
Don't be too quick to pity me
Don't salve my heart with sympathy
Because I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely

[Bridge]
The world looks on with wonder and pity at your kind
Because it knows that the future is not very pretty for your kind

[Verse 3]
Your kind will always be running and wondering
What's happened to hearts that you've broken and left all alone
But we'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
