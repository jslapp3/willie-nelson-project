3 ContributorsSheâ€™s Still Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillow
Then suddenly I realize I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

[Verse 2]
I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone, confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone, you're still gone

[Verse 3]
Still half asleep, I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong, you're still gone

[Verse 4]
The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves, don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own, all alone, she's still goneSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
