3 ContributorsFeed It a Memory Lyrics[Verse 1]
They said that my heart wouldn't have long to live
To lose you was more than it could stand
And that your love was all that could make it survive
But I'm doing all that I can

[Chorus]
I just feed it a memory to keep it alive
A taste of the love that we once knew
And when my heartbeat gets weak and it's starting to die
I just feed it a memory of you

[Verse 2]
I must keep my heart living someway and somehow
In case that you might change your mind
So if you can give it the love that it needs
Just come by and see it some time

[Chorus]
And feed it a memory to help keep it alive
A taste of the love that we once knew
And when my heartbeat gets weak and when it's starting to die
I just feed it a memory of youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
