If I'd only had one arm to hold you
Better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
There'd be one less memory to recall

[Verse 2]
If I'd only had one ear to listen
To the lies that you told to me
Then I'd more closely resemble
The half a man that you've made of me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If I'd only had one leg to stand on
Then a much, a much truer picture you'd see
For then I more closely resemble
The half a man that you've made of meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
