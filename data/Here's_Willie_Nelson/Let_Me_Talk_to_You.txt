2 ContributorsLet Me Talk to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just one more dance
Just one more chance
So I can talk to you
Don't live too fast
Forget the past
And I will try to prove
I would do anything you want me to
Don't run around
Don't paint the town
Let me talk to you

[Verse 2]
Don't go too far
With that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win
Please fall in love again
Give me your heart
So I can start
To build our life anew
I know you've paid
So if you're afraid
Let me talk to youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
