3 ContributorsLonely Little Mansion Lyrics[Intro]
(I'm a lonely little mansion for sale)
Furnished with everything but love

[Verse 1]
I'm looking for someone to come live in me
I've got a large picture window and a yard filled with trees
The sign reads 'two stories' and that's all that's for sale
But there's so many stories I could tell

[Verse 2]
My windows are closed and I'm gasping for air
My carpets are spotted with tear stains here and there
A torn photograph still lies on my floor
And two sweethearts don't live here anymore

[Chorus]
I'm a lonely little mansion for sale
And for someone, I'd fit just like a glove
I'm a lonely little mansion for sale
Furnished with everything but loveSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
