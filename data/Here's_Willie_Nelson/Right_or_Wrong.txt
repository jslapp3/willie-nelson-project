5 ContributorsRight or Wrong Lyrics[Verse]
Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Though I wake with that same old regret

[Verse]
All along, I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart, you love another
But right or wrong, I'm still in love with you

[Verse]
Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Though I wake with that same old regret

[Verse]
All along, I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
Oh Lord, in your heart, you love another
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you, oh LordSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
