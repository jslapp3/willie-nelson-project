5 ContributorsRoly Poly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Roly Poly eating corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly gnawing on a biscuit
As long as he can chew it, it's okay

[Chorus]
He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Roly Poly, Daddy's little fatty
I bet he's gonna be a man someday

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly eats a hearty dinner
It takes lots of strength to run and play

[Chorus]
Well now he pulls up weeds and does the chores
Runs both ways through all the doors
He works up an appetite that way
Roly Poly, Daddy's little fatty
I bet he's gonna be a man somedaySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
