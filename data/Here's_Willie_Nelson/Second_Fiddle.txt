3 ContributorsSecond Fiddle Lyrics[Verse 1]
You asked me if I'd care if you danced with Joe
I said, "Yes, it's all right," but my heart whispered no
For inside I was crying, for last night it was Jim
Must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them?

[Verse 2]
Could it be maybe I'm just imagining things?
Do I really come second with you?
Only you know the answer - is it me, Joe, or Jim?
Must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them?

[Outro]
Only you know the answer - is it me, Joe, or Jim?
Must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them?See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
