4 ContributorsTake My Word Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take my word for what I tell you
I have never lied to you
Pay no mind to what they're saying
I have never been untrue

[Chorus]
Evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
You'll have to take my word when I tell you
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2]
The power of gossip is always strengthened
When it finds a receptive ear
If you listen, the chances are greater
That a thread of doubt may appear

[Chorus]
Evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
You'll have to take my word when I tell you
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
Evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
You'll have to take my word when I tell you
I love you, I love you, I love you
