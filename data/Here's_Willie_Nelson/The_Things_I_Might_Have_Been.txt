2 ContributorsThe Things I Might Have Been Lyrics[Verse 1]
I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store
I might have been without a goal, just dreams and nothing more
I might have known a life alone, but that's where you came in
Your loving arms have saved me from the things I might have been

[Verse 2]
I might have been the kind who roams, a stranger everywhere
Just one of those poor stay-at-homes with no one's lips to share
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin
So keep loving me, don't let me be the things I might have been
