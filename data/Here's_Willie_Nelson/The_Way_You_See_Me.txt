2 ContributorsThe Way You See Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Birds flying south to the one I love
Birds flying high and free
Don't tell my darling that you saw me
Looking the way you see me

[Verse 2]
Winds blowing warm to the one I love
Winds, please kiss her for me
Don't tell my darling that you saw me
Looking the way you see me

[Verse 3]
The way you see me is how I've been
And how ever since she's been gone
But tell her you saw me like I'd like to be
Tell her I'm happy alone

[Verse 4]
River of tears that I have cried
River flow on to the sea
But if you tell my darling you flowed from my eyes
She'd see me the way you see me
She'd see me the way you see meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
