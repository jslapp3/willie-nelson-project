3 ContributorsBeautiful Annabel Lee Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was a child and she was a child
Yet our love was something to see
My parents were poor
I was turned from the door
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee

[Chorus]
Now the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the soft eyes
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee

[Verse 2]
But not even the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can't keep me away
From my meeting someday
With my beautiful Anabel Lee

[Chorus]
And the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the soft eyes
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee
