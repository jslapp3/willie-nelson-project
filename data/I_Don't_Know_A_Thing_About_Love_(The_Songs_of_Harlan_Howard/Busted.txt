4 ContributorsBusted Lyrics[Verse 1]
My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes and I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
And the county's gonna haul my belongings away 'cause I'm busted

[Verse 2]
I went to my brother's, I asked for a loan, 'cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
My brother said, "There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted"

[Verse 3]
I ain't no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gonе and I'm busted
The fields arе all bare and the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
How I'll make a living, Lord, I just don't know 'cause I'm busted

[Outro]
I'm busted
Ain't got no money
Can you loan me a quarter?See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
