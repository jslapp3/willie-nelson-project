4 ContributorsExcuse Me (I Think I’ve Got A Heartache) Lyrics[Verse 1]
They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say

[Chorus]
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may liе and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say

[Chorus]
Excuse mе, I think I've got a heartache
And there's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I crySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
