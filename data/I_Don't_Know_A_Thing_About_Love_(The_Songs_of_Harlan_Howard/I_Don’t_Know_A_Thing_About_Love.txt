I talked to the man in the moon
I said, "Sir, is she coming back soon?"
He smiled and he stated, "Son, I'm over-rated
I’ve had too much credit in those old love tunes"

[Chorus]
And I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love

[Verse 2]
Then I ask him "Where is she tonight?
You must see all things with your light"
He said, "Son, I could tell you things that might kill you
But I don’t get involved in what's wrong or what's right"

[Chorus]
And I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
And I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love

[Chorus]
He said, "I can move oceans when I take the notion
Or make mountains tremble and rivers run dry
But in all matters human, remember there's someone
In charge of those things way above you and I"

And I don't know a thing about love
I just kind of hang here above
I just watch from the sky, will love grow or will it die?
I don't know a thing about love
No, I don’t know a thing about loveEmbed
