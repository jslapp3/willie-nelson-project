4 ContributorsLife Turned Her That Way Lyrics[Verse]
If she seems cold and bitter, I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's gone through
And don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember, life turned her that way

[Chorus]
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it, but that last footprint's mine
She was cryin' when I met her, she cries harder today
So, don't blame her, life turned her that way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it, but that last footprint's mine
She was cryin' when I met her, she cries harder today
So, don't blame her, life turned her that way

[Outro]
No, don't blame her, life turned her that waySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
