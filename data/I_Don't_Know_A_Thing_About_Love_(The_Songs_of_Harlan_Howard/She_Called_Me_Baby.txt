4 ContributorsShe Called Me Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
She called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me until dawn
Then one day I woke and she was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby all night long

[Verse 2]
She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Oh, what I'd give if she'd just come on back home
And call me baby, baby all night long

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
She called me baby, baby all night long
Build me up so high and made me strong
And then one day I woke and she was gone
Now there's no more baby, baby all night long

[Verse 4]
She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby, baby all night long
I still hear baby, baby all night longSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
