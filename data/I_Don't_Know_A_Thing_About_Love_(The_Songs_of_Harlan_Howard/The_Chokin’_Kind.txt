4 ContributorsThe Chokinâ€™ Kind Lyrics[Verse 1]
I only meant to love you don't you know it, babe?
Why couldn't you be contented with the love I gave
I've given you my heart and now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death girl 'cause it's the chokin' kind

[Verse 2]
You can kill a man with bullets, poison, or a knife
But it hurts him more to take his pride and ruin his life
Whatever it is you want girl I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head cause it's the chokin' kind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When you fall in love again girl, take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it, treat it sweet and kind
But let it breathe and don't let go of the chokin' kind
Let it breathe, don't let go, your love is the chokin' kindSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
