4 ContributorsTiger By The Tail Lyrics[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
And I'm losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Verse 1]
I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
Now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
And I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale
God, it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Verse 2]
Wеll every night you drag me whеre the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

[Chorus]
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
And I'm losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tailSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
