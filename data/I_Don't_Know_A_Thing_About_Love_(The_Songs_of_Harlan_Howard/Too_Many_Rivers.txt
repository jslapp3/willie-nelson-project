4 ContributorsToo Many Rivers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I could come back to you, dear
'Cause I know that you want me to
But too much water has run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you

[Chorus]
There's too many rivers to cross, dear
And too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights
That I have turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now don't think for a moment, I blame only you
We both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces that you can't find

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's too many rivers to cross, dear
And there's too many dreams have been lost
There's too many long nights
That I have turned and I have tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
