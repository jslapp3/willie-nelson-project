2 ContributorsBig Booty Lyrics[Chorus 1]
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more sausage
Biscuits and gravy on the side
You done said the wrong thing to me baby
And you can kiss big booty good-bye

[Verse 1]
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more cases
Or fix you nothing else that's chicken fried
Go on and find yourself another woman
And you can kiss big booty good-bye

[Chorus 2]
Go on and find yourself a skinny woman
Something a little more your size
And don't come back to me a moaning
When she cuts you off of burgers and fries

[Verse 2]
She said I ain't gonna fix you no more chicken
And no more Momma's chocolate pies
And here's something heave for you baby
You can kiss big booty good-bye
