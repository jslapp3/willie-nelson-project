3 ContributorsI Didn’t Come Here (And I Ain’t Leavin’) LyricsI built a big pile of peanut shells on the sawdust floor
I winked at every pretty girl comin' in and out the door
Yelling "Hey, bartender, how about two more?"

Bottle by bottle I'm clearin' off that shelf
And I feel so good that I'm not quite myself
Now they're telling me that I gotta find someplace else

(Well, guess what?)
I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'
I've been thrown into better places than this
I didn't come here, so I ain't leavin'
If you wanna pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss

Well I spent my last dollar and drank up my last dime
Now they're acting like having fun is some kind of crime
If it will make you feel better, mister
I'll tell you one more time

I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'
I've been thrown into better places than this
I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'
Why don't you pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss

Now you can call me a taxi
You can call me a cab
I know you're gonna call me something
When I can't pay this tab

Why don't you pucker up I got just the place for you to kissEmbed
