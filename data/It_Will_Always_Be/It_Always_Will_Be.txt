4 ContributorsIt Always Will Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think that love is somewhere
Living on an island all alone
I can see it in the darkness
I can feel it in the distance and then it's gone
And then I know that it is time
For me to go and find my favorite girl
Cause when I look into her eyes I see
All the love there is in all over the world

[Chorus]
And it always will be
And it always will be
And it always will be
It always will be

[Verse 2]
There are some things I think about
And every time I do it breaks my heart
And there is nothing I can do
About this loneliness I feel when we're apart
And I stop and curse the darkness and the distance
And then your face I've see
And when I look into your eyes I've see
All the love there is inside of me
