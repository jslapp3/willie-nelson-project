2 ContributorsLoveâ€™s the One and Only Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
She tries to give up on love every morning
And there's that ceiling and there she is by herself
Wondering if she'll ever find that feeling
Till there's that someone, there'll be no one else

[Chorus]
See the woman won't give her heart away to just anyone
Even though the strongest will don't like to wait
A heart'll do just about anything to feel love
And love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to make

[Verse 2]
A cup of coffee on the dresser, putting on her make up
She looks in the mirror and the mirror has something to say
That loneliness, that needing and that wanting
They're all part of longing, they're your saving grace

[Chorus]
Hey woman don't give your heart away to just anyone
Even though the strongest will don't like to wait
A heart'll do just about anything to feel love
And love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to make

[Bridge]
She believes, though she hasn't found him yet
The stronger her faith, the closer she get's

So the woman won't give her heart away to just anyone
Even though the strongest will don't like to wait
A heart'll do just about anything to feel love
And love's the one and only thing her heart
And love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to makeEmbed
