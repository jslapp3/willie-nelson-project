6 ContributorsMidnight Rider (Duet) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gotta run to keep from hiding
I'm bound to keep on riding

[Chorus]
An' I got one more silver dollar
An' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

[Verse 2]
Well, these ain't my clothes I'm wearing
An' this ol' road goes on forever

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gone by the point of caring
Some ol' bed, I'll soon be sharing

[Chorus]
