2 ContributorsMy Broken Heart Belongs to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lost my mind so long ago
I wanted everyone to know
I wanted everyone to see
My broken heart belong to me
I go beyond the thought of you
And a broken heart was nothing new
I wanted everyone to see
My broken heart belong to me

[Chorus][2x]
And now as autumn fills the air
I feel your spirit everywhere
And now my fears are coming true
My broken heart belongs to you

[Outro]
And now my fears are coming true
My broken heart belongs to youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
