The sun came up and it was blue and gold
The sun came up and it was blue and gold
The sun came up and it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture in a frame

And I come callin' in my Sunday best
I come callin' in my Sunday best
I come callin' in my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture in a frame

And I'm gonna love you 'til the wheels come off
Oh, yeah

The sun came up and it was blue and gold
Sun came up and it was blue and gold
The sun came up and it was blue and gold
Ever since I put your picture in a frame
