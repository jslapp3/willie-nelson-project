2 ContributorsTexas Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Listen to my song
And if you want to sing along
It's about where I belong
Texas

[Verse]
Sometimes far into the night
And until the morning light
I pray with all my might
To be in Texas

[Chorus 2][2x]
It's where I want to be
The only place for me
Where my spirit can be free
Texas
