3 ContributorsThe Way You See Me (2004) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Birds flying south
To the one I love
Birds flying high and free
Don't tell my darling
That you saw me
Looking the way you see me

[Verse 2]
Winds blowing warm
To the one I love
Winds, please kiss her for me
But don't tell my darling
That you saw me
Looking the way you see me

[Chorus]
The way you see me
Is how I've been
And have ever since she's been gone
Just tell her you saw me
Like I'd like to be
And tell her I'm happy alone

[Verse 3]
River of tears
That I have cried
River, flow on to the sea
But don't tell my darling
That you flowed from my eyes
Or she'll see me the way you see me

[Chorus]
The way you see me
Is how I've been
And have ever since she's been gone
Just tell her you saw me
Like I'd like to be
And tell her I'm happy alone

[Verse 3]
River of tears
That I have cried
River, flow on to the sea
But don't tell my darling
That you flowed from my eyes
Or she'd see me the way you see me
She'd see me the way you see meEmbed
