2 ContributorsYou Were It Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were it
You're the one, the only one who understood it all
And when we fought out loud
You'd be the one who would make me feel so small

[Chorus 1]
You could kill
You could hurt
You could bring out the worst in everyone you knew
But no one could ever bring the worst out of you

[Chorus 2]
And I am fine
All the pain is gone
I once had a heart
Now I have a song

[Verse 2]
And you were sly
You were fast
You were built to last
And you lasted 'til the end
And I would fight
I would cry and lay down and die
And then get up again
