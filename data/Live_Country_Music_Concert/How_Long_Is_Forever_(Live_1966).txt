2 ContributorsHow Long Is Forever (Live 1966) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I fell too hard and much too deep in love with you
And I let you come and go at will it seems
Now you're back again this time you say forever
But I wonder just how long forever means

[Chorus]
How long is forever this time
How long until one night you don’t come home again
How long is forever this time
How long until I'm all alone again

[Verse 2]
People say I'm foolish when I take you back
And it could be they’re right but who can say
And you'd be welcome here within my arms forever
Even if forever ends for me today

[Chorus]
How long is forever this time
How long until one night you don't come home again
How long is forever this time
How long until I'm all alone againSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
