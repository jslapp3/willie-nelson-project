2 ContributorsI Just Can’t Let You Say Goodbye (Live 1966) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I had not planned on seeing you
I was afraid of what I'd do
But pride is strong here am I
And I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Please have no fear you're in no harm
As long as you're here in my arms
But you can't leave so please don't try
But I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 3]
What force behind your evil mind
Can make your lips speak so unkind
To one who loves as much as I
I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 4]
The flesh around your throat is pale
Intended by my fingernails
Please don't scream and please don't cry
'Cause I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 5]
Your voice is still it speaks no more
You'll never hurt me anymore
Death is a friend to love and I
'Cause now you'll never say goodbyeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
