3 ContributorsI Never Cared for You (Live 1966) Lyrics[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
The sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Verse]
I know you won't believe these things I tell you
No, you won't believe
Your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
Your mind cannot conceive
Now all depends on what I say to you
And on your doubting me
So I've prepared these statements far from true
Pay heed and disbelieve

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
The sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
The sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you
I never cared for you
I never cared for you

Thank you, thank you very much, thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to do a song now that was recorded by a pretty fair little country group known as  The Beatles. I know you're familiar with those, you've heard them many times on the Grand Ole Opry. Seriously, this is a song that as a songwriter myself, I appreciate it very much. I think it's a very great piece of material and I'd like to do it for you, and I hope you enjoy it.â€‹Embed
