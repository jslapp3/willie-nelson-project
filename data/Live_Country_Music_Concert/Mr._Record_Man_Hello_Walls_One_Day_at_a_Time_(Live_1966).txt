Panther Hall Ballroom, long noted as the country and western capitol of the great southwest takes great pleasure in bringing to it's stage, tonight, for your pleasure, one of the finest song stylists in contemporary country and western music. Let's make him welcome then with a great big Texas sized welcome, Willie Nelson.â€‹

Thank you very much. Before I get started let me introduce the orchestra to you. Most of you are familiar with them already, uh, not too familiar I hope. Back here on the drums from uh San Antonio, Texas is a boy who is very outstanding in his field, in fact, that's where I found him was out standing in a field. He's very uh talented, he's a good writer, a good singer, he's gonna be one of the big names in the country music business before very long. A nice hand if you will for Mr. Johnny Bush. And over here on my extreme left we have John Birch, no that's not right is it? No, we have one of the very best entertainers, musicians, singers, that's ever graced the bandstand anywhere of any club or stage, and I'm very honored to have him with the Willie Nelson Show. Would you make welcome none other than Mr. Wade Ray. Just between you and me he's a dirty old man, but we're...

[Part I; Mr. Record Man]

[Verse 1]
Mr. Record Man I'm looking for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing about someone who went away
Just like me his heart was yearning for a love that used to be
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Chorus]
There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man get this record for me won't you please
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Verse 2]
I was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
And the man that I heard singing sound so blue and all alone
As I listened to his lonely song I wondered could it be
Could there somewhere be another lonely man like me?

[Chorus]
There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man get this record for me won't you please
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Verse 1]
Hello walls, how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

[Verse 2]
Hello window, well, I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain

[Bridge]
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can

[Verse 3]
Hello ceiling, I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me a while?
We gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I gotta feeling she'll be gone a long, long time

[Part III: One Day At A Time]
[Chorus]
I live one day at a time
I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
And I live one day at a time

[Verse 1]
Guess that's your surprised to see me back at home
But you know how much that I miss you when I'm gone
But don't ask how long I plan to stay it never it crossed my mind
'Cause I live one day at a time

[Verse 2]
See that sparrow fly across the cloudy sky
Searching for a patch of sunlight so am I
Wish I didn't have to follow and perhaps I want in time
But I live one day at a time

[Chorus]
I live one day at a time
I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
And I live one day at a time
I live one day at a timeEmbed
