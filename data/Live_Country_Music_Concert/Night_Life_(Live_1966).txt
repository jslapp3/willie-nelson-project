2 ContributorsNight Life (Live 1966) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging around

[Refrain]
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Verse 2]
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams

[Refrain]
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Bridge]
Listen to the blues they're playing
Now listen to what the blues are saying

[Verse 2]
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams

[Refrain]
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Bridge]
Listen to the blues they're playing
And listen to what the blues are saying

[Verse 2]
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams

[Refrain]
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Outro]
Thank you, thank you very much.â€‹Embed
