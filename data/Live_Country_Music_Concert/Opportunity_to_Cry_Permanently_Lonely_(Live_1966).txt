4 ContributorsOpportunity to Cry/Permanently Lonely (Live 1966) Lyrics[Part I: Opportunity To Cry]

[Verse 1]
I just watched the sunrise on the other side of town
Once more I've waited and once more you've let me down
This would be a perfect time for me to die
So I'd like to take this opportunity to cry

[Verse 2]
You gave your word now I return it to you
With this suggestion as to what you can do
Just exchange the words I love you for goodbye
While I take this opportunity to cry

[Verse 3]
I'd like to see you but I'm afraid
That I don't know wrong from right
And if I saw you would I kiss you
Or want to kill you on sight

[Verse 4]
It's been a long night so I think I'll go home
And feed my nightmares they've been waiting all, all night long
They'll be the last ones to tell me goodbye
And they'll give me many opportunities to cry

[Verse 1]
Don't be concerned it's time I learned
That those who play with fire get burned
But I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely

[Verse 2]
Don't be too quick to pity me
Don't salve my heart with sympathy
Because I'll be alright in a little while
Ah, but you'll be permanently lonely

[Verse 3]
The world looks on with wonder and pity at your kind
'Cause it knows that the future is not very pretty for your kind
For your kind will always be running and wondering
What's happened to hearts that you've broken and left all alone
But we'll be alright in a little while but you'll be permanently lonely
Running lonelyEmbed
