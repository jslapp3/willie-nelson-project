3 ContributorsSomething to Think About (Live 1966) Lyrics[Intro]
Thank you, thank you very much. I had a request earlier to do uh, from somebody that knew I guess. I have a new song that I'd like to do for you and see what you think about it, well let’s just put it on this album tonight. I wrote it oh two or three days ago. It's called, it's called, it’s called "That's Something To Think About".​

[Verse]
You're wondering just what I'll do now that it's over and done
Well that's something to think about and I've already begun
I suppose that I'll find a way people usually do
But it’s something to think about I’ll be lost without you

[Chorus]
One thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have any sweetheart you choose
Here is something to think about I'll still be thinking of you

One thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have any sweetheart that you choose
Here is something to think about I’ll still be thinking of youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
