3 ContributorsThe Last Letter/Half a Man (Live 1966) Lyrics[Part I: The Last Letter]

[Verse 1]
Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend?
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold?
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old?

[Verse 2]
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all the clothes that your young body craves
And so if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Just think of the teardrops, and the heartaches, and sorrow you'll save

[Verse 3]
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
And to this old world I'll soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

[Part II: Half A Man]

[Verse 1]
If I'd only had one arm to hold you
Better yet if I had none at all
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
There'd be one less memory to recall

If I'd only had one ear to listen
To the lies that you told to me
Then I'd more closely resemble
The half a man that you've made of me

[Verse 3]
If I'd only had one leg to stand on
Then a much, a much truer picture you'd see
'Cause then I more closely resemble
The half a man that you've made of meEmbed
