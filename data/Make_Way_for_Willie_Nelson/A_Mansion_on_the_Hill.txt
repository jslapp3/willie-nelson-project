2 ContributorsA Mansion on the Hill Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin

[Refrain]
I can see your mansion on the hill

[Verse 2]
Do you recall when we parted?
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear

[Refrain]
In your loveless mansion on the hill

[Verse 3]
I've waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
'Cause I know that you're living in sorrow

[Refrain]
In your loveless mansion on the hill

[Verse 4]
The light shines bright from your window
And the trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear
