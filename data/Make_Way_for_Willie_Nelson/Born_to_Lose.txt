I'm born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue

[Refrain]
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through

[Refrain]
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
And you were all the happiness I knew

[Refrain]
I'm born to lose and now I'm losing youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
