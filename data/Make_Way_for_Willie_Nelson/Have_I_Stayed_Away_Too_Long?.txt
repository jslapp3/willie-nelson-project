Have I stayed away too long?
Have I stayed away too long?
If I come home tonight, would you still be my darling?
Or have I stayed away too long?

[Verse 2]
The love light that shone so strong
Sweet love light that shone so strong
If I came home tonight, would that same light be shining?
Or have I stayed away too long?

[Chorus]
I'm just outside of town and I'll soon be at your door
But maybe I'd be wrong to hurry there
I'd best keep out of town and worry you no more
Maybe someone else has made you care

[Verse 3]
Have all of my dreams gone wrong?
My beautiful dreams gone wrong
If I came home tonight, would you still be my darling?
Or have I stayed away too long?
If I came home tonight, would you still be my darling?
Or have I stayed away too long?See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
