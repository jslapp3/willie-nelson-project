3 ContributorsHave I Told You Lately That I Love You? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told you how with all my heart and soul I need you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

[Chorus]
My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream that I dream is you somehow?
And have I told you how my every thought is in your keeping?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

[Chorus]
My world would end today if I should lose you
'Cause I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you nowSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
