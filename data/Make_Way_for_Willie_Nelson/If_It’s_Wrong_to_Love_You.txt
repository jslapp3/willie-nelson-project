3 ContributorsIf Itâ€™s Wrong to Love You Lyrics[Verse]
If it's wrong to love you, wrong I'll always be
And though the world may scorn me, darling, can't you see
If it's wrong to want you when my day is through
Gladly I will pay for all my dreams of you

[Chorus]
And though we met too late dear, and you'll never know
That without a right to I have loved you so
I can't change my heart now, you're a part of me
So if it's wrong to love you, wrong I'll always be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And though we met too late dear, and you'll never know
That without a right to I have loved you so
I can't change my heart now, you're a part of me
So if it's wrong to love you, wrong I'll always be
And if it's wrong to love you, wrong I'll always beSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
