1 ContributorLovinâ€™ Lies Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll never understand dear as long as I live
I guess I will always wonder why
You told me that you loved me with all of your heart
And then without a warning said goodbye

[Chorus]
The loving lies that I believed
And now how I grieve
You didn't mean it from the start
And you told me loving lies and broke my heart

[Verse 2]
You say I'll soon forget you and find someone new
But, darling how wrong you are
I only had one love dear and that was for you
And from that love my heart will bear the scar

[Chorus]
Loving lies that I believed
And now how I grieve
You didn't mean it from the start
So you told me loving lies and broke my heart
So you told me loving lies and broke my heartSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
