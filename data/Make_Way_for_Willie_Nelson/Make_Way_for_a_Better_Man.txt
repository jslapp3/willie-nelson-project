2 ContributorsMake Way for a Better Man Lyrics[Intro]
Hear me talking now

[Verse 1]
You tried to make her happy
You couldn't make her happy
Make way for a better man than you

[Verse 2]
You tried your brand of loving
She couldn't stand your loving
Make way for a better man than you

[Chorus]
I held back 'cause you and I were friends
But old buddy this is where our friendship ends
I'm taking over now
Those signals she keeps sending means your romance is ending
Make way for a better man than you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Those fancy words you told her
Were not enough to hold her
Make way for a better man than you

I guess you ran your luck out
You came to bat and struck out
Make way for a better man than you

[Chorus]
I held back 'cause you and I were friends
But old buddy this is where our friendship ends
I'm taking over now
Those signals she keeps sending means your romance is ending
Make way for a better man than you
Make way for a better man than you1Embed
