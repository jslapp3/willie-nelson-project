5 ContributorsOne in a Row Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you can truthfully say
That you've been true just one day

[Refrain]
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Verse 2]
And if you can look into my eyes
One time without telling lies

[Refrain]
Well that makes one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Bridge]
Why do I keep loving you
After all the things you do

[Verse 3]
And just one time come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms

[Refrain]
That will make one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Verse 3]
And just one time come into my arms
And be glad that you're in my arms

[Refrain]
That will make one in a row
One in a row, one in a row

[Outro]
