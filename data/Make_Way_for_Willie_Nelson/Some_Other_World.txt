Some other world has all the sunshine
'Cause there's no sunshine in mine
Out of the darkness came thunder and rain
Leaving my dreams all in vain

[Chorus]
Some other world there sleeps my darling
There where the skies are always blue
Why don't they take me out of this world
And let me find my sunshine with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Some other world there sleeps my darling
There where the skies are always blue
Why don't they take me out of this world
And let me find my sunshine with youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
