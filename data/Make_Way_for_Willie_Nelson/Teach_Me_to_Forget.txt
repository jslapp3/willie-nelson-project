2 ContributorsTeach Me to Forget Lyrics[Verse 1]
You taught me how to love with all my heart
With all my soul I trusted you
And now you say we'll have to live apart
A thing I don't know how to do

[Verse 2]
You said someday I'd find somebody new
And I have not one regret
But stay a while if what you say is true
Stay and teach me to forget

[Verse 3]
You taught me how to worship you alone
And now you say you have to go
And people call me on the telephone
Just to say, "I told you so"

[Verse 4]
I know now that I only learned to live
On the night when first we met
God above will teach me to forgive
But stay and teach me to forget
Please stay and teach me to forgetSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
