1 ContributorWhat Now My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
What now, my love? Now that you've left me
How can I live through another day?
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay

[Verse 2]
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

[Verse 3]
What now, my love? Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

[Verse 4]
What now, my love? Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live, or if I should die

[Verse 5]
What now, my love? Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
Only my last, my last goodbyeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
