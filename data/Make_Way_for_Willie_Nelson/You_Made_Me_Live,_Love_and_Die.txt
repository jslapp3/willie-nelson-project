2 ContributorsYou Made Me Live, Love and Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
I cried and cried my heart out but what good does it do
Crying never bothers anyone so cold as you
I've thought the whole thing over and now I'll go and find
A better place where angels heal broken hearts like mine

[Refrain]
You made me live, you made me love and now you'll make me die

[Verse 2]
I'll never live or love again, there's no need now to try
I'll say farewell to this old world this is my last goodbye

[Refrain]
You made me live, you made me love, and now you'll make me die

[Verse 3]
And just for night is over, I'll never see the day
I'll hold your picture to my heart and then I'll be on my way
I'll say farewell to this old world, this is my last goodbye

[Refrain]
You made me live, you made me love, and now you'll make me dieSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
