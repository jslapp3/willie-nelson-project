4 ContributorsBlack Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
Way down in Louisiana
Among the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominicker hen
And a rose of a different name
The first time I fell lightly
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name

[Chorus]
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time, I did it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man
And help me leave that black rose alone

[Verse 2]
When the devil made that woman
Lord, he threw the pattern away
Well she were built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day
Way down, deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
You'll find this cain-raising man doing it again
With a rose of a different name

The devil made me do it the first time
The second time, I did it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man
And help me leave that black rose alone

The devil made me do it the first time
The second time, I did it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man
And help me leave that black rose aloneEmbed
