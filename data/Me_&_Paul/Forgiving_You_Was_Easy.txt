6 ContributorsForgiving You Was Easy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forgiving you was easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time
I just keep thinking
And your memory is forever on my mind

[Chorus]
You know I'll always love you
And I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

[Verse 2]
The bitter fruit of anger
Growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh, what a heartache
But I forgive the things you said to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe forgiving
Is the only way that I'll find peace of mind
And forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

[Verse 3]
The years have passed so quickly
As once again fate steals a young man's dreams
Of all the golden years
And growing old together, you and me

You asked me to forgive you
You said there was another on your mind
And forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

[Outro]
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time2Embed
