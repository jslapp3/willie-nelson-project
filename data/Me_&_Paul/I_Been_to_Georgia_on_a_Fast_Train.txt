7 ContributorsI Been to Georgia on a Fast Train Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a rainy windy morning, on the day that I was born
In that old sharecroppin' one-room country shack
They said my mammy left me
The day before she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back
And I just like to mention
That my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standin' here today
An' I got all my country learnin'
A-milkin' and churnin'
Pickin' cotton, raisin' hell and balin' hay

[Chorus]
I've been to Georgia on a fast train, honey
I wadn't born no yesterday
I gotta good Christian raisin'
And an eighthh-grade education
And ain't no needin' y'all a'treatin' me this way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, my sweet Carolina
I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you are
I love your wiggle and your walkin'
And your big city talkin'
And your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car
Well, it's hurry up and wait
In this land of give and take
It seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I declare to my soul
When I hear them ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

I've been to Georgia on a fast train, honey
I wadn't born no yesterday
I gotta good Christian raisin'
And an eighth-grade education
And ain't no needin' y'all a'treatin' me this way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've been to Georgia on a fast train, honey
I wadn't born no yesterday
I gotta good Christian raisin'
And an eighth-grade education
And ain't no needin' y'all a'treatin' me this way
