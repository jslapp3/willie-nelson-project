I let my mind wander
And what did it do?
It just kept right on going
Until it got back to you

[Verse 2]
I can't trust it one minute
It's worse than a child
Disobeys without conscience
And it's driving me wild

[Pre-Chorus]
When I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today
But invariably, memories
Seem to lure it away

[Chorus]
My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
On thoughts of today
But invariably, memories
Seem to lure it away

My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way

[Outro]
'Cause I let my mind wander
I let my mind wander
I let my mind wanderEmbed
