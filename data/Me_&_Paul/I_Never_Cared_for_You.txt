8 ContributorsI Never Cared for You Lyrics[Verse]
I know you won't believe these things I tell you
No, you won't believe
Your heart has been forewarned, all men will lie to you
Your mind cannot conceive
Now all depends on what I say to you
And on your doubting me
So I've prepared these statements far from true
Pay heed and disbelieve

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
The sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
And the sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you

[Outro]
And I never cared for you
