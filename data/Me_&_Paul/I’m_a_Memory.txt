5 ContributorsIâ€™m a Memory Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a game that you used to play
And I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
I'm a fire that burns in your mind

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
I'm a memory

[Verse 2]
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
I'm a memory

[Verse 2]
I'm a dream that comes in the night
And I'm a face that fades with the light
And I'm a tear that falls out of sight

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
I'm a memorySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
