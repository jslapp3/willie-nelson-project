3 ContributorsOld Five & Dimers Like Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be
More than the measure of what I thought others could see
Good luck and fast bucks they're too few and too far between
There's catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me

[Verse 2]
She stood beside me letting me know she would be
Something to lean on if everything ran out on me
Well fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not ever will be
The reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
It's taking me so long now that I know I believe
All that I do or say is all I ever will be
Too much isn't enough for old five and dimers like me
Too far and too high and too deep isn't too much to see
An old five and dimer is all I intended to beSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
