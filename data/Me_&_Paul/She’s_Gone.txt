1 ContributorShe’s Gone LyricsShe is gone but she was here
And her presence is still heavy in the air
What a taste of human love
Now she's gone and it don't matter anymore

Crossing dreams with our lives
It was more than just a woman and a man
It was love without disguise
Now my life will never be the same again

She is gone but she was here
And her presence is still heavy in the air
What a taste of human love
Now she's gone and it don't matter anymore

Crossing dreams with our lives
It was more than just a woman and a man
It was love without disguise
And now my life will never be the same againSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
