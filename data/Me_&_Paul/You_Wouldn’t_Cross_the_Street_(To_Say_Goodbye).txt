5 ContributorsYou Wouldnâ€™t Cross the Street (To Say Goodbye) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Today, I stood across the street and watched you leave with him
Right before my disbelieving eyes
And when you saw me standing there, you turned away from me
And you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Once you said, you'd do almost anything to keep our love
You'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies
Once you said, you'd go to any lengths to be with me
Today, you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Today, I stood across the street and watched you leave with him
Right before my disbelieving eyes
And when you saw me standing there, you turned away from me
And you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Once you said, you'd do almost anything to keep our love
You'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies
Once you said, you'd go to any lengths to be with me
Today, you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbyeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
