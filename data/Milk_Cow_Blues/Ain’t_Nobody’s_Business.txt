3 ContributorsAin’t Nobody’s Business Lyrics[Intro]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
It ain't nobody's business if I do
Some of these days I'm going crazy
Buy me a shotgun, shoot my baby
It ain't nobody's business if I do

[Verse 2: Jonny Lang]
(If I should take a notion
To go right down and jump in the ocean
It ain't nobody's business if I do)

[Verse 3]
One day I have chicken and dumplins
The next day I don't have nothing
It ain't nobody's business if I do
And if I attended church on Sunday
And cabaret all day Monday
Well it ain't nobody's business if I do
And if I stay out all night
And spend my money, well that's alright
It ain't nobody's business if I do

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
It ain't nobody's business if I doEmbed
