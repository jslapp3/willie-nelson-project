2 ContributorsBlack Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nobody cares about me
Ain't even got a friend
Baby's gone and left me
When will my troubles end?

[Chorus]
Black night is fallin'
Oh, how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone

[Verse 2]
I've got no one to talk with
To tell my troubles to
Don't even know I'm living since I lost you

[Chorus]
Black night is fallin'
Oh, how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone

[Verse 3]
My mother has her troubles
My father has his too
My brother's in Korea
And I don't know just what to do

Black night, black night is fallin'
Oh, how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is goneEmbed
