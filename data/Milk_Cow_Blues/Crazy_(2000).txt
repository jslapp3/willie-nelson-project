1 ContributorCrazy (2000) LyricsI'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so lonely
And I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wondering
What in the world did I do

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Crazy for trying
Crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wondering
What in the world did I do

I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Crazy for trying
Crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
