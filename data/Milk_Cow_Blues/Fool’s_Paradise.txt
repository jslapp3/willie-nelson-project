2 ContributorsFoolâ€™s Paradise Lyrics[Verse 1]
I often think off the live I live
And it's a wonder that I ain't dead
Drinking and gambling
And staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise
My mother told me, my father told me too
Someday my child, fate will catch up with you
Drinking and gambling
And staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

[Chorus 1]
I though I had learned my lesson
Like all fools I have met
But there are things I've learned in this world
I'll remember to my dying day

[Chorus 2]
My father told me, my mother said it right
Said my child, you are ruining your life
Drinking and gambling
And staying out all night
Living in a fool's paradise

[Chorus 1]
Well I though I had learned my lesson
Like all fools I have met
But there are things I've learned in this world
I'll remember to my dying day
