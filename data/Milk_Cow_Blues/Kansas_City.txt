I'm goin' to Kansas City, baby
Kansas City, here I come
I'm goin' to Kansas City, baby
Kansas City, here I come
They got some mighty pretty women there
And I'm gon' get me one

[Verse: Susan Tedeschi]
I'm gonna be standin' on the corner, the corner of 12th Street and Vine
I'll be standin' on the corner of 12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby and drinkin' that Kansas City wine

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
Well, I might take a boat, I might take a train
But if I have to walk, you know I'm goin' there just the same
I'm goin' to Kansas City, baby
Kansas City, here I come
They got some mighty pretty women there
And I'm gon' get me one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
Well, I might take a boat, I might take a train
But if I have to walk, you know I'm goin' there just the same
I'm goin' to Kansas City, baby
Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come
They got some mighty pretty women there
And I'm gon' get me one
They got some mighty pretty women there
And I'm gon' get me one
They got some mighty pretty women there
I'm gon' get me oneSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
