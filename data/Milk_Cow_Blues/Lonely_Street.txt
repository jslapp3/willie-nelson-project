3 ContributorsLonely Street Lyrics[Verse]
I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called lonely street?

[Chorus 1]
A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

[Chorus 2]
Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

[Chorus]
If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?

[Post-Chorus]
Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called lonely street?Embed
