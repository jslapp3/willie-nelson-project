Well I woke up this morning looked out my door
I can tell my milk cow, could tell by the way she lows
So if you see my milk cow, won't you drive her on home
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter, since my cow's been gone

[Verse 2: Francine Reed]
Now you gotta treat me right, baby
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
Cause you gonna need, you gonna need my help someday
And you going to be sorry, that you treated me this way

[Verse 3: Willie Nelson]
Well I said sail, sail on
I said sail on pretty gal, sail on
Well I said sail, sail on
I said sail on pretty gal, sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing
Until you lose your happy home
(Let me hear you make it)
Well I tried everything little woman, to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
Gon' quit my crying leave you alone
If you don't think I'm leaving
You can just count the days I'm gone
Cause you ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more

And you going to be wondering
Where in this world I'm gone
