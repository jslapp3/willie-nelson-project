1 ContributorRainy Day Blues (2000) LyricsWell it's cloudy in the morning gonna be raining in the afternoon
Cloudy in the morning and it's gonna be raining in the afternoon
If you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move

But if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
If you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
Is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me

Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather guess I'll never see the sun again

Save those dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
Save your dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
It ain't gonna keep the rain from coming but at least you know you've paid your way

Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather guess I'll never see the sun againSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
