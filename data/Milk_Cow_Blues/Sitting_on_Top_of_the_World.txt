4 ContributorsSitting on Top of the World Lyrics[Chorus]
It was in the summer, not in the fall
I spent all my money on alcohol
And now you're gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse]
No need of crying, holding out your hand
'Cause I can get a woman, quick as you get a man
But you're gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
If you see me stealing, don't you tell on me
I'm just stealing back to old used to be's
'Cause now you're gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
It was in the summer, not in the fall
I spent all my money on alcohol
And now you're gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the worldSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
