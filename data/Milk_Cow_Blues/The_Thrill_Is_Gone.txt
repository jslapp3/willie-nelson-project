3 ContributorsThe Thrill Is Gone Lyrics[Chorus]
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong
And you'll be sorry someday

[Verse 1: B.B. King]
(Thrill is gone, gone away from me
Thrill is gone, gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
Oh, so lonely I'll be)

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
You know I'm free from you baby
I am free from your spell
Well I'm free, free, free from you
I'm free from your spell
Now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well

[Chorus: Both]
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong
And you'll be sorry somedaySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
