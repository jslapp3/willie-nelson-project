7 ContributorsHeaven and Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes I take it as far as I can
And sometimes I don't even go

[Chorus]
My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered with snow
Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even know
Play it little sister

[Verse 2]
And heaven ain't walking
On a street paved with gold
And hell ain't no mountain of fire
Heaven is laying
In my sweet baby's arms
And hell is when baby ain't there

[Chorus]
My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered with snow
Sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even know

Sometimes it's heaven, and sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even knowEmbed
