6 ContributorsI Still Can’t Believe You’re Gone Lyrics[Verse]
This is the very first day since you left me
And I've tried to put my thoughts in a song
But all I can hear myself singing
Is, I still can't believe you're gone
I still can't believe that you'd leave me
What did I do was so wrong
There's just too many unanswered questions
And I still can't believe you're gone

But
[Chorus]
You're gone and I'm alone and I'm still living
I don't like it but I'll take it till I'm strong
And all I can hear myself singing is
Is, I still can't believe you're gone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I still can't believe you're goneSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
