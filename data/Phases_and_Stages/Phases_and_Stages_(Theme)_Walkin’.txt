5 ContributorsPhases and Stages (Theme)/Walkinâ€™ Lyrics[Chorus]
After carefully considering
The whole situation I stand with my back to the wall
Walking is better than running away and crawling ain't no good at all

[Verse]
And if guilty's the question truth is the answer I've been lying to me all alone
There ain't nothing worth saving except one another
And before you'll wake up I'll be gone

[Chorus] [2x]

[Outro]
And crawling ain't no good at allSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
