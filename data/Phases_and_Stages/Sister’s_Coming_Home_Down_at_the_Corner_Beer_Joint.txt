[Verse 1]
My sister's coming home
Mama's going to let her sleep the whole day long
Well, the whole day long
My sister's coming home
Mama's going to let her sleep the whole day long

[Verse 2]
My sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
Well, that done her wrong
My sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong

[Guitar and Fiddle Solos]

[Verse 1]
My sister's coming home
Mama's going to let her sleep the whole day long
Well, oh, the whole day long
My sister's coming home
Mama's going to let her sleep the whole day long
The mirror's going to tell her just how long she's been gone
[Down at the Corner Beer Joint]
[Verse 1]
Down at the corner beer joint
Dancing through the rock and roll
Sister likes to do it
Lord, sister likes to move her soul
Down at the corner beer joint
Dancing on a hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before

Oh, than they did before
Oh, than they did before
Lord, her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
Oh, than they did before
Oh, than they did before
Oh, well her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before

[Pedal Steel and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 2]
Down at the corner beer joint
Dancing to the rock and roll
Sister likes to do it
Lord, sister likes to move her soul
Down at the corner beer joint
Dancing on the hardwood floor
Oh, well her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before

[Chorus]
Oh, than they did before
Oh, than they did before
Well her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
[Outro]
She likes to move her soul
Likes to move her soul
Sister likes to do it
Lord, sister likes to move her soulEmbed
