I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I overlooked before
First is the sunshine, the second is rain
Third is the roses that bloom in the lane

[Chorus 2]
There's no need explaining
The one remaining is somebody I adore
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I overlooked before

[Chorus 1]
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I overlooked before
First is the sunshine, the second is rain
Third is the roses that bloom in the lane

[Chorus 2]
There's no need explaining
The one remaining is somebody I adore
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I overlooked before
There's no need explaining
The one remaining is somebody I adore
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
That I overlooked beforeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
