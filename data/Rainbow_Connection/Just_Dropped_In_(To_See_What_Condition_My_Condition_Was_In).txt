4 ContributorsJust Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with the sundown shining in
Found my mind in a brown paper bag again
Tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky

[Chorus]
And I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in

[Verse 2]
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and followed it in
Met myself crawling out as I was crawling in
I woke up so tight i said I'd never unwind
I saw so much that it broke my mind

[Chorus]
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in

[Verse 3]
Somebody painted April Fool in big black letters
On a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas
When I left the road, it blew out my mind
Eight miles out of Memphis, Lord, I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere

I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
What condition my condition was in
