3 ContributorsOlâ€™ Blue Lyrics[Verse]
I had a dog and his name was Blue
I'll tell you what old Blue would do
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
He'd go out every night about dark
And it wouldn't be long 'til you'd hear him bark
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
And I'd go out to see what he had
It'd be a great big opossum up a black-jack tree
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
I'd get a stick and I'd knock him down
I'm gong to bake that opossum good and brown
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
Ol' Blue he died and he died so hard
That he graveled little holes all over the yard
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
I dug his grave with a silver spade
And I lowered him down with a golden chain
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
And when I get to heaven, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'm gonna get my horn and call ol' Blue
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah Blue
Yeah Blue, yeah Blue, yeah BlueSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
