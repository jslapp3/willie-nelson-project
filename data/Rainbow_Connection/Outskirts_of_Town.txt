3 ContributorsOutskirts of Town Lyrics[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
Well I'm going tell you baby
We'll move away from here
Gonna sell my icebox and buy me a Frigidaire
When we move out on the outskirts of town
Cause I don't want nobody foolin' or always hanging round
It may sound funny honey, funny as it can be
If we ever have any children
I want 'em all to look like me
When we move, way out on the outskirts of town
Cause I don't want nobody fooling there always hanging round

[Verse 2: Keb' Mo']
I'm going bring me own grocery
I'm going bring 'em everyday
I don't like that grocery boy
I gotta keep him away
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
No no, I don't want nobody always hanging round
Well now, I don't want nobody always hanging roundSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
