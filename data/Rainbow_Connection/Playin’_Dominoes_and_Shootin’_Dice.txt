2 ContributorsPlayin’ Dominoes and Shootin’ Dice Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once I knowed a guitar picker, lived his life on wine and liquor
Running around in one of them new machines
He was about the proudest feeling, wheeling, dealing
Sneaking, stealing, aggravating man I've ever seen
Nothing but a midnight rambler, biggest drunkard and a gambler
He'd do anything that wasn't nice
Hunting, golfing, fishing, swimming, running around with other women

[Chorus]
Playing dominoes and shooting dice

[Verse 2]
Then one night as he was dining, while the moon was brightly shining
With his secret love he was so gay
He would laugh and call her 'Honey' while she proudly spent his money
As they hugged and smooched the time away
Laughing, joking, dining, dancing
Planning parties and romancing, having fun regardless of the price
Eating caviar and chicken, strumming his guitar and picking

[Chorus]
Playing dominoes and shooting dice

[Verse 3]
Then his wife walked in and found him with that pretty girl around him
Started making headway for the gate
When he seen those girls dividing, he commenced to slip and sliding
But he seemed to know it was too late
Crowds began to getting thinner, they jumped up and left their dinner
No one seemed to have an appetite
Not a person dare defend her, everyone jumped out the window
No one hung around to see the fight
Then she grabbed him by the collar, he commenced to squeal and holler
As she plastered him betwixt the eyes
And then his old guitar she swung it, over his head she proudly hung it
Bruises, knots and bumps began to rise
He leapt up and tried to squeeze her, but she warped across the beezer
Pulled a pistol and shot him once or twice
When the wicked fight was over, he was laid beneath the clover
