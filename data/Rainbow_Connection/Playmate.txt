Playmate, come out and play with me
And bring your dollies, three
Climb up my apple tree
Look down my rain-barrel
Slide down my cellar door
And we'll be jolly friends forever more

[Chorus 1]
But she couldn't come out and play
It was a rainy day
With tearful eye she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say

[Chorus 2]
I'm sorry, playmate, I cannot play with you
My dolly's got the flu, boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hasn't got no rain-barrel, hasn't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends forever more

[Chorus 1]
But she couldn't come out and play
It was a rainy day
With tearful eye she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say

I'm sorry, playmate, I cannot play with you
My dolly's got the flu, boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hasn't got no rain-barrel, hasn't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends forever moreEmbed
