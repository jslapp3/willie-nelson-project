6 ContributorsRainbow Connection Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why are there so many songs about rainbows?
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see

[Chorus]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

[Verse 2]
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
And what's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do you think we might see?

[Chorus]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

[Bridge]
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one in the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be

[Chorus]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and meEmbed
