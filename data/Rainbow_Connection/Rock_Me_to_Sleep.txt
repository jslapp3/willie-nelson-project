3 ContributorsRock Me to Sleep Lyrics[Vesre 1]
All I can hear are the crickets
And the whistle from some lonely freight
I've been working so hard to make everything right
But for now it'll just have to wait

[Chorus]
Because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
I'd like you to sing me a song
I'm tired of trying to figure things out
And I'm tired of being so strong

[Verse 2]
I've never been too good at asking
I'm more apt to do it alone
And it's strange how a lot of us think something's wrong
If we can't do it all on our own

[Chorus]
Because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
I'd like you to sing me a song
I'm tired of trying to figure things out
And I'm tired of being so strong

[Verse 3]
It's funny how times when your hurting
Make what's so familiar seem strange
And when you need help, it's hardest to ask
And it always takes so long to change

Because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
I'd like you to sing me a song
I'm tired of trying to figure things out
And I'm tired of being so strongEmbed
