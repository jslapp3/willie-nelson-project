2 ContributorsWise Old Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
One day I got the notion to teach a fish to fly
So I went down to the ocean when the tide was plenty high
Found a fish, we talked, and I pointed to the sky
But he didn't even try, no, he didn't even try

[Chorus]
No one listens to wise old me
And I know how things ought to be
I ain't blind but sure don't see
Why no one listens to wise old me

[Verse 2]
One day I said to me, "let's teach a bird to swim"
So I climbed way up a tree and I went out on a limb
Found a bird, we talked, and I pointed to the sea
And that bird just sang to me, that bird just sang to me
As sure as clouds live in the sky, there's a place for you and I
If you don't learn to let things be you'll find your wise self up a tree
Now, please do not be frightened by the things that sound absurd
As how man can be enlightened by the wisdom of a bird
And so can you, so let it be a lesson for today
And may I never hear you say, may I never hear you say

[Chorus]
No one listens to wise old me
And I know how things ought to be
I ain't blind but sure don't see
Why no one listens to wise old me
No one listens to wise old meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
