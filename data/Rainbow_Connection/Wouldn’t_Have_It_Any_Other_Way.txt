2 ContributorsWouldnâ€™t Have It Any Other Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
If we're backing up it's just to get a running start
Because everything we do we do with all our hearts
And it don't really matter what they say
We wouldn't have it any other way
We play our songs and play our old guitars
And it don't really matter where we are
We wake up in a new world every day
And we wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
We wouldn't have it any other way
And it don't really matter what they say
We wake up in a new world every day
And we wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 2]
And when it's time for us to move along
To a place we sometimes sing of in our songs
Raise your glasses high on that fine day
Because we wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
We wouldn't have it any other way
And it don't really matter what they say
We wake up in a new world every day
And we wouldn't have it any other way
We wouldn't have it any other waySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
