Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
And I assure you, I'll do you no wrong

[Verse]
Don't know why, but the one I love left me
Left me lonely and cold and so weak
And I need someone's arms to hold me
'Til I'm strong enough to get back on my feet
Can I sleep in your arms?
Can I sleep in your arms?

[Chorus]
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrong

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrongSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like2Embed
