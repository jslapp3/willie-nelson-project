7 ContributorsBubbles in My Beer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past rise before me
Watching the bubbles in my beer

[Verse 2]
Visions of someone who loved me
Brings a long silent tears to my eye
And I know that my life's been a failure
Watching the bubbles in my beer

[Verse 3]
I'm seeing the road that I've travelled
A road filled with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
Watching the bubbles in my beerSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
