Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet, pulling out all of his hair
Now, Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

[Verse 1]
Well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't play music if you don't know nothing to play

[Chorus]
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now, John T. Floores was a-working for the Ku Klux Klan
At six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

[Chorus]
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family thereSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like3Embed
