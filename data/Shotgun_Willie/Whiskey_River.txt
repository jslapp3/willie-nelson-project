Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

[Chorus]
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

[Bridge]
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

[Chorus]
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
