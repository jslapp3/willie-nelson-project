6 ContributorsYou Look Like the Devil Lyrics[Chorus 1]
You look like the devil in the morning
You've been out a working through the night
Holding hands and kissing everybody
I'm glad to say that you can't blow my mind

[Chorus 2]
You look like the devil when you're crying
I'm so glad that you feel so strong that way
You got a great big smile for everybody
I'm so glad I've met you yesterday

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
You look like the devil in the morning
You've been out a working through the night
Holding hands and kissing everybody
I'm glad to say that you can't blow my mind

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2]
You look like the devil when you're crying
I'm so glad that you feel so strong that way
You got a great big smile for everybody
I'm so glad I've met you yesterday
