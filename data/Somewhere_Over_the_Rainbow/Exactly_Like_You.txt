2 ContributorsExactly Like You Lyrics[Intro]
I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you

[Verse]
Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel so grand
I want to give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

[Chorus]
Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel so grand
I want to give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like youEmbed
