2 ContributorsIn My Motherâ€™s Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
One bright and guiding light
That taught me wrong from right
I find in my mother's eyes

[Verse 2]
Those fairy tales she told
Of streets paved with gold
I find in my mother's eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a wandering sparrow
Far from its foe
I walk the straight and narrow
Just to reach my goal

[Chorus]
God's gift sent from above
A real unselfish love
I find in my mother's eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a wandering sparrow
Far from its foe
I walk the straight and narrow
Just to reach my goal
