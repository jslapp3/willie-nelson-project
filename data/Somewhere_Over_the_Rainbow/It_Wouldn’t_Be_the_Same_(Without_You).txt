3 ContributorsIt Wouldnâ€™t Be the Same (Without You) Lyrics[Verse]
I could wander the byway, re-wander too
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Those familiar old places would just make me blue
Because it wouldn't be the same without you

[Chorus]
I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without you

I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
