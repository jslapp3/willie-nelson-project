2 ContributorsI’m Confessin’ (That I Love You) Lyrics[Verse]
I'm confessing that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessing that I need you
Honest I do, need you every moment!
In your eyes I read such strange things
But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

[Chorus]
I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying can't we still be friends?
If you go, you know you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends
Am I guessing that you love me?
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Saying can't we still be friends?
If you go, you know you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends
Am I guessing that you love me?
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again!See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
