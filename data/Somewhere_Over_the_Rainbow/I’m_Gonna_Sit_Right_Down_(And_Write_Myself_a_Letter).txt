I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to write words oh so sweet
They're going to knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got them

[Verse]
I'm going to smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
I'll close with love the way you do

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
Oh yeah

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to write words oh so sweet
They're going to knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got them
Oh yeah
