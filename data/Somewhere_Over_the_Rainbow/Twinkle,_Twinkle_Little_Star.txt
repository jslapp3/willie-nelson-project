Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky

[Chorus]
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

[Verse 2]
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night

[Chorus]
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

[Verse 3]
Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so

Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

[Verse 4]
In the dark blue sky, you keep
While you throw my window peep
And you never shut your eye
Till the sun is in the sky

[Chorus]
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are1Embed
