2 ContributorsWhoâ€™s Sorry Now? Lyrics[Verse]
Who's sorry now, who's sorry now
Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow
Who's sad and blue, who's crying too
Just like I cried over you

[Chorus]
Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry nowSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
