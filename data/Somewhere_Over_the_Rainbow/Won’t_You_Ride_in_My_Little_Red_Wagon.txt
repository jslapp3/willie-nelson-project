4 ContributorsWonâ€™t You Ride in My Little Red Wagon Lyrics[Verse]
Won't you ride in my little red wagon?
I'd love to pull you down the street
And I know all the kids will be jealous
When they see my playmate so sweet

[Chorus]
Hold tight 'til we come to the hilltop
Going to coast down the hill, you and me
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
For you are my sweetheart-to-be
Hold tight 'til we come to the hilltop
Going to coast down the hill, you and me
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
For you are my sweetheart-to-beSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
