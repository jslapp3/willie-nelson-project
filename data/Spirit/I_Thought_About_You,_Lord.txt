Thought about trees
How much I'd like to climb one
I thought about friends
And how rare it is to find one

[Chorus]
I thought about You
The most gentle, sweet and kind one
I thought about You, Lord
I thought about You

[Verse 2]
I thought about life
The way that things are going
I thought about love
And the pain that comes with growing

[Chorus]
And I thought about You
The one who is all knowing
I thought about You, Lord
I thought about You

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about You
And the songs that I keep singing
And I thought about You
And the joy that they keep bringing

I thought about life
And a love that has no ending
I thought about You, Lord
I thought about You

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about You
And the songs that I keep singing
I thought about You
And the joy that they keep bringing

[Chorus]
I thought about life
And a love that has no ending
I thought about You, Lord
I thought about You

[Outro]
I thought about You, Lord
I thought about YouEmbed
