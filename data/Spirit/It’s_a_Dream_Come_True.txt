2 ContributorsItâ€™s a Dream Come True LyricsIt's a dream come true
I can't believe that it's just me and you
Seeing worlds so far apart
Come together in our hearts
It's a dream come true
It's a dream come true
There is nothing that a dream can't do
I dreamed of love and I was given you
You're a dream come true
These are changing times
A universe within our minds

With all the power of a love divine
It's a dream come true
It's a symphony
And all the notes ring out in harmony
It's the music of the stars
It fulfills all my desires
It's a dream come true
It's the music of the stars
It fulfills all my desires
It's a dream come trueSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
