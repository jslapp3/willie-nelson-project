3 ContributorsIâ€™m Not Trying to Forget You Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I've got back into remembering all the love we had before
And i'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
So i'm not trying to forget you anymore

[Verse]
You're just someone who brought happiness into my life
And it did not last forever, oh, but that's alright
We were always more than lovers and i'm still your friend
And if i had the chance, i'd do it all again

[Chorus]
I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I've got back into remembering all the love we had before
And i'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
So i'm not trying to forget you anymore

I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I've got back into remembering all the love we had before
And i'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
So i'm not trying to forget you anymoreSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
