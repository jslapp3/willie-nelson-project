4 ContributorsIâ€™m Waiting Forever Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm waiting forever for you
For this is my destiny
This is what I am to do

[Verse 1]
But forever isn't no time at all
It's only the time
Between telephone calls
And the love that I hear
And your voice is so clear coming through
Keeps me waiting forever
Waiting forever for you

[Chorus]
I'm waiting forever for you
For this is my destiny
This is what I am to do

[Verse 2]
Waiting is no waste of time
I just play out the scenes
On a stage in my mind
I love making love to your memory
It's all that I do
While I'm waiting forever
Waiting forever for youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
