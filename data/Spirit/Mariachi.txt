3 ContributorsMariachi LyricsThat's my favorite part, rewind my life on
When my world got dark, and you turned my light on
I watched it for hours again and again in my head
I did
I see I was down on you, more than I needed to be
I'd say I'm sorry but then you'd think I'm lyin'

Chorus:
Maria, shut up and kiss me
Stop shakin', stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me. You need me. Believe me
Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carryin' on
That's my favorite shirt, you always had on
Man, It sure looked good, ev'ry time you walked on
You're takin' the wind from me every chance that you could
You're good
Somethin' I can't explain
You tell me lately I've changed
If you feel better tell me why are you cryin'?

(Repeat Chorus)
Maria, Maria can we talk it over instead?
Let's call it even and leave it alone
Come to bed
Maria, stop leavin' your teasin' is beaten me down
Maria just calm down
In these situations I've found it's best not to be proud
And say that you're sorry
Maria, shut up and kiss me
Stop shakin', stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me. You need me. Believe me
Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carryin' on
And it turns me on and on
On and on
On and on
And it turns me on and on
On and on
On and on
On and on and on and on...See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
