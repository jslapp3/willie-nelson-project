3 ContributorsShe Is Gone Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I got back into remembering all the love we shared before
And I'd been trying to forget someone who my heart still adores
So I'm not trying to forget you anymore

[Verse]
You were someone who brought happiness into my life
And it did not last forever but that's all right
We were always more than lovers and I'm still your friend
And if I had the chance I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
So I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I got back into remembering all the love we had before
And the best days of my life are still when you walk through that door
So I'm not trying to forget you anymoreSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
