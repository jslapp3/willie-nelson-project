5 ContributorsToo Sick to Pray Lyrics[Verse]
I've been too sick to pray, Lord
That's why we haven't talked in a while
It's been some of them days, Lord
I thought I was on my last mile
But I'm feeling okay lord
And I'm glad that I called you today
Never needed you more
I woulda called you before
But I've been too sick to pray
Remember the family Lord
I know they will remember you
And all of their prayers, Lord
They talk to you just like I do

[Chorus]
Well, I reckon that's all, Lord
That's all I can think to say
And thank you my friend
We'll be talking again
If I'm not too sick to pray
Well, I reckon that's all, Lord
That's all I can think to say
Thank you my friend
We'll be talking again
I'm not too sick to praySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
