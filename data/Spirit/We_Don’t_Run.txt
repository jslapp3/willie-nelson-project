4 ContributorsWe Donâ€™t Run Lyrics[Chorus]
We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

[Verse 1]
You are the road, you are the only way
I'll follow you forever more
We'll look for love, we'll find it in the eyes
The eyes that see through all the doors
There is a train that races through the night
On rails of steel that reach the soul
Fueled by fire as soft as candle light
But it warms the heart of a love grown cold

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Words that feel, words that sympathize
Words that heal and understand
Say them now, let them materialize
Say the words throughout the land
