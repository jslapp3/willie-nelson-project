3 ContributorsYour Memory Wonâ€™t Die in My Grave Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been feeling kind of free
But I sure do feel lonesome
Baby's taking a trip
But she isn't taking me
I've been feeling kind of free
But I'd rather feel your arms around me
Because you're taking away
Everything that I wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
There's an old hollow tree
Where we carved our initials
And I said I love you
And you said you love me

[Chorus]
It's a memory today
It'll be a memory tomorrow
I hope you'll be happy someday
(And) Your memory won't die in my grave

[Pre-Chorus]
