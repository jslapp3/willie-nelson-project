4 ContributorsDonâ€™t Get Around Much Anymore Lyrics[Verse]
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

[Chorus]
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you don't get around much anymoreSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
