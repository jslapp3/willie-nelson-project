6 ContributorsGeorgia on My Mind Lyrics[Verse]
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
An' just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

[Chorus]
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
