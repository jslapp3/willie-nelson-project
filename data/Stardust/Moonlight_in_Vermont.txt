6 ContributorsMoonlight in Vermont Lyrics[Verse]
Pennies in a stream
Fallen leaves of sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
Icy fingers waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snow light in Vermont

[Chorus]
Telegraph cables swing down the highway
Travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadow lark
Moonlight in Vermont

[Chorus]
Telegraph cables swing down the highway
Travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadow lark
Moonlight in Vermont
