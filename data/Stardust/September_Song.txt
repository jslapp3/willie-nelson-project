5 ContributorsSeptember Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, it's a long long while
From May to December
But the days grow short
When you reach September
When the autumn weather
Turns leaves to flame
One hasn't got time
For the waiting game

[Chorus]
Oh, the days dwindle down
To a precious few
September, November

[Verse 2]
And these few precious days
I'll spend with you
These precious days
I'll spend with you

[Chorus]
Oh, the days dwindle down
To a precious few
September, November

And these few precious days
I'll spend with you
These precious days
I'll spend with you
These precious days
I'll spend with youEmbed
