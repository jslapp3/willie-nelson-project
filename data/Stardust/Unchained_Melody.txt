5 ContributorsUnchained Melody Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

[Chorus]
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

[Verse 2]
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
