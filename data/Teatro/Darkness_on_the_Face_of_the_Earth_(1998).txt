3 ContributorsDarkness on the Face of the Earth (1998) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The morning that you left me was just another day
How could I see the sorrow that had found me
And then you left and told me that I was in your way
And I turned and ran as heaven fell around me

[Verse 2]
I stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure
I live within a world that had no sunshine
But when you left me darling my world came to an end
And there was darkness on the face of the earth

[Chorus]
And the stars fell out of heaven, the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me? You knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The stars fell out of heaven, the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me? You knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth
