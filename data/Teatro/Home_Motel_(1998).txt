1 ContributorHome Motel (1998) Lyrics[Verse 1]
What used to be my home has changed to just a place to stay
A crumbling last resort when day is through
Sometimes between sundown and dawn somehow I find my way
To this Home Motel on Lost Love Avenue

[Verse 2]
No one seems to really care if I come here at all
And the one who seems to care the least is you
I'm gonna hang a neon sign with letters big and blue
Home Motel on Lost Love Avenue

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
No one seems to really care if I come here at all
And the one who seems to care the least is you
I'm gonna hang a neon sign with letters big and blue
Home Motel on Lost Love Avenue

[Outro]
