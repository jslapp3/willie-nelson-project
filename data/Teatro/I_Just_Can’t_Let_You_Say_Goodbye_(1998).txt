1 ContributorI Just Canâ€™t Let You Say Goodbye (1998) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I had not planned on seeing you
I was afraid of what I'd do
But pride is strong and here am I

[Refrain]
And I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 2]
What force behind your evil mind
Can let your lips speak so unkind
To one who loves as much as I

[Refrain]
And I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 3]
The flesh around your throat is pale
Intended by my fingernails
Please don't scream, please don't cry

[Refrain]
'Cause I just can't let you say goodbye

[Verse 4]
Your voice is still it speaks no more
You'll never hurt me anymore
Death is a friend to love and I

'Cause now you'll never say goodbye

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I had not planned on seeing you
I was afraid of what I'd do
But pride is strong and here am I

[Refrain]
Now you'll never say goodbyeEmbed
