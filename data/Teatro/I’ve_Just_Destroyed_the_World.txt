6 ContributorsIâ€™ve Just Destroyed the World Lyrics[Verse 1]
The sun just went behind the clouds
There's darkness all around me now
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in

[Verse 2]
I broke her heart so many times
And now at last I've broken mine
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in

[Chorus]
What made me think that I could go on hurting her?
I had to known there had to be an end
But fools in love are taught by faith
We never learn 'til it's too late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What made me think that I could go on hurting her?
I had to known there had to be an end
But fools in love are taught by faith
We never learn 'til it's too late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
