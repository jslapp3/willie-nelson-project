3 ContributorsIâ€™ve Loved You All Over the World Lyrics[Verse]
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend
It will be that way until the end
And wherever you go, I want you to know
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend

[Verse 2]
And I've loved you all over the world
You are my sunshine
You keep my life in a whirl
And you love me sometimes

[Chorus]
I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the world

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the world
