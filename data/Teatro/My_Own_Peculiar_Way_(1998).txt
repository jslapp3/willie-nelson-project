1 ContributorMy Own Peculiar Way (1998) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It would be a comfort just to know you never doubt me
Even though I give you cause most every day
Sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me

[Refrain]
Although I love you in my own peculiar way

[Verse 2]
And don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wander
To a suddenly remembered yesterday
My mind could never stay too long away from you

[Refrain]
And I always love you in my own peculiar way

[Verse 3]
And though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
And though my faults may grow in number day by day
Let no one ever say that I've ever been untrue

[Refrain]
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way

And though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
And though my faults may grow in number day by day
Let no one ever say I've ever been untrue

[Refrain]
I'll always love you in my own peculiar way
I'll always love you in my own peculiar wayEmbed
