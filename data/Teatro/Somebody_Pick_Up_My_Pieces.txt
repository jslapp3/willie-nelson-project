Somebody pick up my pieces, I'm scattered everywhere
And put me back together and put me way over there
Take me out of contention, I surrender my crown
So somebody pick up my pieces, it's just me coming down

[Verse 2]
Well, I sure thought I had her, Lord I know she had me
But what I thought was heaven, is just falling debris
Well, I may not be crazy, but I got one hell of a start
Somebody pick up my pieces, I think I'm falling apart

[Chorus]
And don't follow my footsteps, step over my trail
The road is too narrow and your footing could fail
And the fall to the bottom could tear you apart
And they'll be picking up pieces of you and your heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And don't follow my footsteps, step over my trail
The road is too narrow and your footing could fail
And the fall to the bottom could tear you apart
And they'll be picking up pieces of you and your heart
