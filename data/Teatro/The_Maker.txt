4 ContributorsThe Maker Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh deep water, black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open, I've run a twisted mile
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the maker

[Verse 2]
I could not see for fog in my eyes
I could not feel for the fear in my life
And across the great divide in the distance I saw a light
Saw Jean Baptiste walking to me with the maker

[Verse 3]
My body is bent and broken by long and dangerous leaps
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the maker

[Verse 4]
Brother John have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords there over east of Eden
Burning in the eyes of the maker

[Outro]
Burning in the eyes of the maker
Burning in the eyes of the maker
Oh river (Oh river) rise from your sleepSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
