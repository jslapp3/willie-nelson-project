2 ContributorsThese Lonely Nights Lyrics[Chorus]
Lonely nights I cannot sleep I just lie awake and weep
Wondering if I'll get a chance to make things right
Don't you have a heart at all, can't you see my teardrops fall?
They are tears I shed for you these lonely nights

[Verse]
Won't you reconsider this? You're the one dear, that I miss
Won't you come back here and say that you'll be mine
We could be so happy then I would love you 'til no end
There would be no broken hearts or lonely nights

[Chorus]
Lonely nights I cannot sleep I just lie awake and weep
Wondering if I'll get a chance to make things right
Don't you have a heart at all, can't you see my teardrops fall?
They are tears I shed for you these lonely nights

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Won't you reconsider this? You're the one dear, that I miss
Won't you come back here and say that you'll be mine
We could be so happy then I will love you 'til no end
There would be no broken hearts or lonely nights
