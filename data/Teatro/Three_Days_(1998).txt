1 ContributorThree Days (1998) Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
Three days that I hate to see arrive
Three days that I hate to be alive
Three days filled with tears and sorrow
Yesterday, today and tomorrow

[Verse]
There are three days that I know that I'll be blue
Three days that I'll always dream of you
But it does no good to wish these days would end
'Cause the same three days start over again

[Chorus]
Three days that I hate to see arrive
Three days that I dread to be alive
Three days filled with tears and sorrow
Yesterday, today and tomorrow

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Three days that I hate to see arrive
Three days that I dread to be alive
Three days filled with tears and sorrow
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
