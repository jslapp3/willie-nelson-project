1 ContributorRemember the Alamo Lyrics[Verse 1]
A hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
The man who would fight to the death cross over and him who would live better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine

[Chorus]
Aiy Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo

[Verse 2]
Though Bowie lay dying his powder was ready and dry
From flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And brave David Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fierce in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die

[Chorus]
Aiy Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo

[Verse 3]
They sent a young scout through the battle much bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
"Don't grieve little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be"

That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo
