2 ContributorsSan Antonio Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was walking when the sun came up this morning
I was walking when the sun went down last night
Cursing the day that I walked away
From the loved ones and friends I know in San Antonio

[Verse 2]
I was so intent in leaving home last fall
All the world was mine and I could feel the call
Luring me on to places unknown
Far from the hills of home back in San Antone

[Bridge]
I must admit I'm just a homeboy
A San Antone boy, a far-from-home boy
I hear the call of San Antonio
And that's where I plan to go

[Verse 3]
Fate has turned my back on all that I wanted so
Now I know that I was never meant to roam
So I cursed the day that I walked away
As I return to stay in San Antonio

[Outro]
