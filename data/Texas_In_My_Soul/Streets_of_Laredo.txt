4 ContributorsStreets of Laredo Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy wrapped all in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

[Chorus]
Oh, beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

[Verse 2]
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die"

[Chorus]
Beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the green valleys, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

[Verse 3]
"Go fetch me some water, a cool drink of water
To cool my parched lips," the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
He had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead

Beat the drum slowly, play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the green valleys, and lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I known I've done wrong
I'm a young cowboy and I known I've done wrongEmbed
