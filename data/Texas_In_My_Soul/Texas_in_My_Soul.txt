3 ContributorsTexas in My Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Amarillo, San Antone
Any old place I call my home
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul

[Verse 2]
Dallas, Forth Worth, Saint Angelo
Houston, Austin or El Paso
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
It is there I know my place is
I see only smiling faces and so

[Chorus]
Partner the rest of the world's not worth
A pound of good old Texas dirt
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul

[Verse 3]
Corpus Christi, Del Rio
West of the Peagus or old Waco
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul

[Verse 4]
Sweetwater, Beaumont, Wichita Falls
Port Arthur, Brownsville, I hear you call
I got to go, I've got Texas in my soul

Where the tumbleweeds are growing
I know it's there that I'll be going to stay

[Chorus]
I've been a Texan since my birth
No place like it on this earth
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Where the tumbleweeds are growing
I know it's there that I'll be going to stay

[Chorus]
I've been a Texan since my birth
No place like it on this earth
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul
I got to go, I got Texas in my soul
I got to go, I got Texas in my soulEmbed
