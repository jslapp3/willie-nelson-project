1 ContributorThe Hill Country Theme Lyrics[Verse 1]
The Hill Country
The Hill Country of Texas
The Hill Country
The country that I love

[Chorus]
Where wild wings fly
Above the peaceful valleys
And the Pedernales
Flows lazily beneath the Texas skies

[Verse 2]
The Hill country
The Hill country of Texas
It knew my folks, my family
And my friends

[Verse 3]
The boy who rode his pony in the sunlight
The man who prayed at midnight
And gave him strength
To carry on again

[Bridge]
And when the night falls
And when my God calls

Where wild wings fly
Above the peaceful valleys
By the Pedernales
Please let me sleep beneath the Texas skies

[Bridge]
And when the night falls
And when my God calls

[Chorus]
Where wild wings fly
Above the peaceful valleys
By the Pedernales
Please let me sleep beneath the Texas skiesEmbed
