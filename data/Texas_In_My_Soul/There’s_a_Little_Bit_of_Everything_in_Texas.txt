There's a little bit of everything in Texas
Just look around and you will see
There's a little bit of everything in Texas
And a whole lot of Texas in me

[Verse 1]
There are forty nine states around it
And each of them have treasures of their own
And everything they boast of I sure found it
But we've got them all right here at home

[Verse 2]
If you love old sunny California
Or perhaps the hills of Tennessee
No matter what you love just come to Texas
And I'll bet my boots you will agree

[Chorus]
That there's a little bit of everything in Texas
And really I'm not bragging you see
There's a little bit of everything in Texas
And a whole lot of Texas in me

If you love old sunny California
Or perhaps the hills of Tennessee
No matter what you love just come to Texas
And I'll bet my boots you will agree

[Chorus]
That there's a little bit of everything in Texas
And really I'm not bragging you see
There's a little bit of everything in Texas
And a whole lot of Texas in me
And a whole lot of Texas in meEmbed
