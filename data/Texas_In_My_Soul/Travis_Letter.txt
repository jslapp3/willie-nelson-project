1 ContributorTravis Letter LyricsCommandancy of the Alamo San Antonio, February 24th 1836

To the people of Texas and all the Americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots. I am besieged with a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna and I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for twenty-four hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender of discretion
Otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then I call on you in the name of liberty and of patriotism and of everything dear to the American character to come to our aide with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined to sustain as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his country.​ Victory or Death!

William Barrett Travis, Lieutenant Colonel, Commandant

P.S.​ The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses eighty or ninety bushels and got into the walls twenty or thirty head of beeves.​
