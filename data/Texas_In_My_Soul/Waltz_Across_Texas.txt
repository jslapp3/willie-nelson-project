4 ContributorsWaltz Across Texas Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we dance together, my world's in disguise
It's a fairyland tale that's come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you

[Chorus]
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms
Waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you

[Verse 2]
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
The moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine, dear, I could dance all night long
I could waltz across Texas with you

[Chorus]
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms
Waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
