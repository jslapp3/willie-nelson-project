Who put my Alice in Dallas?
Who put my Ann in San Antone?
Who took my gal down in Galveston?
She never ever came back home

[Chorus]
Texas, I don't know what you've got
But whatever it is, you sure have got a lot
Who put all my exes in Texas?
Who took all my gals away from me?

[Verse 2]
One had a beau down in Beaumont
Another fell in Wichita Falls
I lost my Abby down in Abilene
Now she never even calls

[Chorus]
Texas, I don't know what you've got
But whatever it is, you sure have got a lot
Who put all my exes in Texas?
Who took my gals away from me?

[Verse 3]
Who made the pass in El Paso?
That's where I lost one or two
Who put amour in Amarillo
In Houston, Fort Worth, and Corpus Christi too?

Texas, I don't know what you've got
But whatever it is, you sure have got a lot
Who put all my exes in Texas?
Who took all my gals away from me?
Who took all my gals away from me?Embed
