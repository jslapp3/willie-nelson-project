You called me Country Willie the night you walked away
With the one who promised you a life of joy
You thought my life too simple and yours was much too gay
To spend it living with a country boy
So I'm writing you this letter, I write you every day
I hope that you've received the ones before
But I've heard not one word from you and every day I pray
That you will not forget your country boy

[Verse 2]
While you're living in the city with riches around your door
Is this your love, is this your kind of joy
Or do you find there's something missing, does your heart cry out for more
And do you sometimes miss your country boy?

[Verse 3]
A cottage in the country with roses around the door
Could not compete with flashing city lights
But it's all I have to offer except for one thing more
A heart so filled with love that it could die
Well it's time to end this letter, the light of dawn is near
A lonely night has passed but there'll be more
Just one more thing in closing for all the world to hear
Come home, I love you signed your country boySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
