You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to control you
Like the other little children
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin'
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you
It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you
When you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire till the dawn

But it's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

When you go out to play this evenin'...See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
