1 ContributorJimmyâ€™s Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is Jimmy's road where Jimmy liked to play
This is Jimmy's grass where Jimmy liked to lay around

[Verse 2]
And this is Jimmy's tree that Jimmy likes to climb
But Jimmy went to war and something changed his mind around

[Verse 3]
This is the battleground where Jimmy learned to kill
Now Jimmy has a trade and Jimmy knows it well, too well

[Verse 4]
This is Jimmy's grave where Jimmy's body lies
And when a soldier falls Jimmy's body dies and dies

[Verse 1]
But this is Jimmy's road where Jimmy likes to play
This is Jimmy's grass where Jimmy likes to lay aroundSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
