4 ContributorsThe Sound in Your Mind Lyrics[Chorus]
Well, I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
It's a little like rain but it's a lot like a sunny day

[Post-Chorus]
And it's hard to explain but the sound of your name
Don't make music anymore
It's more a sound of a love that I lost one day

[Verse 1]
It's a little too late
To start thinking about starting all over
I'd rather stay where I am
I can't take another slam in the mind

[Chorus]
I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
But remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mind

[Verse 2]
I've been running around
Even laughing at half of the memories
You're not hard to remember
I just have to think of your name

I've been feeling a little bad
'Cause I've been feeling a little better without you
But remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mindEmbed
