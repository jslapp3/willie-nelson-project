6 ContributorsWhoâ€™ll Buy My Memories Lyrics[Verse 1]
A past that's sprinkled with the blues
A few old dreams that I can't use
Who'll buy my memories of things that used to be?

[Verse 2]
There were the smiles before the tears
And with the smiles, some better years
Who'll buy my memories of things that used to be?

[Chorus]
When I remember how things were
My memories all lead to her
I'd like to start my life anew
But memories just make me blue

[Verse 3]
A cottage small, just built for two
A garden wall with violets blue
Who'll buy my memories of things that used to be?

[Chorus]
When I remember how things were
My memories all lead to her
I'd like to start my life anew
But memories just make me blue

A cottage small, just built for two
A garden wall with violets blue
Who'll buy my memories of things that used to be?1Embed
