4 ContributorsWill You Remember Mine Lyrics[Verse]
Sweet is the song when the song is love
Love that has stood the test of time
And when you've heard all the songs of love
Will you remember mine
Gone are the times when I walked with you and held your hand in mine
Now when you hold another's hand
Will you remember mine

[Chorus]
I have sat beneath the trees while the cool summer breeze
Blew away the sands of time
And thought of days when you were near
Remembering when you were mine
Gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine
Now when you kiss another's lips
Will you remember mine

I have sat beneath the trees while the cool summer breeze
Blew away the sands of time
And thought of days when you were near
Remembering when you were mine
Gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine
Now when you kiss another's lips
Will you remember mineSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
