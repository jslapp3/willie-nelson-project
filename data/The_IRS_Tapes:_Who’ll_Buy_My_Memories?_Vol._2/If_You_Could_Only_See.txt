And if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
If you could see our love directing time
If you could only see what's going through my mind

And if you only knew the values of unknowns
And if you could see transitions going on
And if my lips could speak the words, the truth you'd find
If you could only see what's going through my mind

If you could only see what's going through my mind
And if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
And if you could see our love directing time
If you could only see what's going through my mind

If you could only see what's going through my mind
If you could only see what's going through my mind
If you could only see what's going through my mindSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
