3 ContributorsI’d Rather You Didn’t Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You told me you'd love me forever
But the one in your arms is not me
So if this is what you refer to as love
Then I'd rather you didn't love me
I have waited so long for your love now
But I've made up my mind it can't be
For if I am just one of the many you love
Then I'd rather you didn't love me

[Verse 2]
How can I name the one to blame?
I suppose it's the way you believe
But if this is what you refer to as love
Then I'd rather you didn't love me
And if I am just one of the many you love
Then I'd rather you didn't love me
I'd rather you didn't love meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
