4 ContributorsIâ€™m Falling in Love Again LyricsI'm falling in love again
Never thought I would again
Never I thought I would

And I may be making mistakes again
But if I lose or win
How will I know? How will I know?
How will I know? How will I know?

And I'm falling in love again
And if I lose or win
How will I know?See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
