2 ContributorsOpportunity to Cry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just watched the sunrise on the other side of town
Once more I've waited and once more you’ve let me down
This would be a perfect time for me to die
So I'd like to take this opportunity to cry

[Verse 2]
You gave your word now I return it to you
With this suggestion as to what you can do
Just exchange the words I love you for goodbye
While I take this opportunity to cry

[Verse 3]
I'd like to see you but I’m afraid
That I don't know wrong from right
And if I saw you would I kiss you
Or want to kill you on sight

[Verse 4]
It's been a long night so I think I'll go home
And feed my nightmares they've been waiting all, all night long
They'll be the last ones to tell me goodbye
And they'll give me many opportunities to cry
They'll give me many opportunities to crySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
