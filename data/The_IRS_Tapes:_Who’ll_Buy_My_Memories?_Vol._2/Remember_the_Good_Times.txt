4 ContributorsRemember the Good Times LyricsRemember the good times they're smaller in number and easier to recall
Don't spend too much time on the bad times
They're staggering in number and will be heavy as lead on your mind

Don't waste a moment unhappy invaluable moments gone with the leakage of time
As we leave on our own separate journeys
Moving west with the sun to a place buried deep within our minds
