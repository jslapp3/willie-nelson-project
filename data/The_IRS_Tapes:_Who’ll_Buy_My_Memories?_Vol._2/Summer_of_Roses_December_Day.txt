5 ContributorsSummer of Roses/December Day LyricsA short time I have to be with you my love
But a short time is better than no time you see
So I bring to you all my posessions and would that you share them with me
I bring one springtime of robins one springtime of robins to sing
I bring you one summer of roses one summer of roses I bring
I bring you the dry leaves of autumn dry leaves will be helpful you know
To soften the fall of your snowflakes when I bring you your winter of snow

This looks like a December day this looks like a time to remember day
And I remember a spring such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college where the green leaves of knowledge
Were waiting to fall with the fall
And where September wine numbed a measure of time
Through the tears of October
Now November's over and this looks like a December day
This looks like a December day it's looks like we've come to the end of the way
And as my mem'ries race back to loves eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending the ending that won't go away
And as my mem'ries race back to loves eager beginning
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending the ending that won't go away
And this looks like a December daySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
