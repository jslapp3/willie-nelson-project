5 ContributorsWhat Can You Do to Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
What can you do to me now
That you haven't done to me already
You broke my pride and made me cry out loud
What can you do to me now

[Verse 2]
I'm seeing things that I never thought I'd see
You've opened up the eyes inside of me
How long have you been doing this to me
I'm seeing sides of me that I can't believe
Someway somehow I'll make a man of me
I will build me back the way I used to be
Much stronger now the second time around because
What can you do to me now
What can you do to me nowSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
