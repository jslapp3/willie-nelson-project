3 ContributorsA Penny for Your Thoughts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Memories are haunting you and they're making you feel blue

[Chorus 1]
Darling a penny for your thoughts

[Verse 2]
Are you thinking of the past and a love that didn't last

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
And it hurts me so to see the sorrow written on your face
And I hope and pray that some tomorrow I can take his place
But if someday we should part you can say a broken heart
