4 ContributorsAmazing Grace Lyrics[Chorus]
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me

[Verse 1]
I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hours I first believed

[Chorus]
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me

[Verse 2]
Now when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise that when we first begun

[Chorus]
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
