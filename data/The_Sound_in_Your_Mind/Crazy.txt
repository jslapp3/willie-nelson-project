15 ContributorsCrazy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

[Verse 2]
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

[Verse 3]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, "What in the world did I do?"

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like3Embed
