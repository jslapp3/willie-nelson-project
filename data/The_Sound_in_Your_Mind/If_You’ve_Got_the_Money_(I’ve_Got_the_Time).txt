8 ContributorsIf You’ve Got the Money (I’ve Got the Time) Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, a-one, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1]
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
We'll go honky-tonking and we'll have a time
We'll have more fun, baby, all way down the line
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

[Verse 2]
There ain't no need to tarry, let's start out tonight
We'll have fun, oh boy, oh boy, and we'll do it right
Bring along your Cadillac, leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
We'll go honky-tonking, make every spot in town
We'll go to the park where it's dark and we won't fool around
If you run short of money, then I'll run short of time
If you've got no more money, honey, I have no more time

[Verse 4]
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time
We'll go honky-tonking and we'll have a time
Bring along the old Cadillac, leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like1Embed
