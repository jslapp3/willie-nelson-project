2 ContributorsThanks Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thanks for what a little love you gave to me
And thank you for my escape from misery
I searched and found heaven and then lost it again
I'm not sorry forgiving all my love to you
And if they ask if I still love you I'll have to say I do


[Chorus 1]
My heart was dead and you've made it live and die again
And then they learn from my mistakes so thanks again

[Verse 2]
My reason for existing is now reveal
I'm just here to show the world how blue a man could feel
