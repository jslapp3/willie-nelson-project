3 ContributorsThat Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Up in the morning out on my job work like a devil for my pay

[Chorus 1]
And that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do but roll around heaven all day

[Verse 2]
Fuss with my woman toil with my kids sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Lord above can't you see I'm crying tears are in my eyes
Sending down my cloud with that silvery lining take me to paradise
Show me that river lead me across take all my troubles away
