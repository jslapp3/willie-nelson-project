6 ContributorsThe Healing Hands of Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
They're working while I'm missing you, those healing hands of time
And soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine
They'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time

[Verse 2]
And they let me close my eyes just then, those healing hands of time
Soon they'll let me sleep again, those healing hands of time
And already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time

[Verse 3]
They let me close my eyes just then, those healing hands of time
Soon they'll let me sleep again, those healing hands of time
Already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time

[Refrain]
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
