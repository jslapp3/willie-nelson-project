5 ContributorsIn the Garden Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known, this is true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling
But He bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Chorus]
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever knownSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
