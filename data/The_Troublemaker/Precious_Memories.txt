2 ContributorsPrecious Memories Lyrics[Verse 1]
Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold

[Chorus]
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold

[Verse 2]
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere

[Verse 4]
I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me

[Chorus]Embed
