2 ContributorsShall We Gather Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angels he has brought
With it's crystal tides forever
Flowing by the throne of God

[Chorus]
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful, river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God

[Verse 2]
On the margin of the river
Washing up its silver spray
We will talk and worship ever
All the happy golden day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ere we reach the shining river
Lay we every burden down
Praise our spirits will deliver
And provide our robe and crown

[Verse 4]
Soon we'll reach the shining river
Soon our pilgrimage will cease
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace

[Chorus]Embed
