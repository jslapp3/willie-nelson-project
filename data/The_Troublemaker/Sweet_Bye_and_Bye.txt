3 ContributorsSweet Bye and Bye Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there

[Chorus]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

[Verse 2]
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days
