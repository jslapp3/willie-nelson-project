3 ContributorsThere Is a Fountain Lyrics[Verse]
There is a fountain
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel’s veins
And sinners plunged, beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains[x3]
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there may I, though vile as he
Wash all my sins away[x3]
And there may I, though vile as he
Wash all my sins away
E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die[x3]

[Outro]
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die[x2]See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
