3 ContributorsWhere the Soul Never Dies Lyrics[Verse 1]
To Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Chorus]
No sad farewells (Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells)
No tear dimmed eyes (There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes)
Where all is love (Where all is peace and joy and love)
And the soul never dies (And the soul of man never dies)

[Verse 2]
The rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines and lights the way to home
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Verse 4]
My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never dies

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And the soul never diesEmbed
