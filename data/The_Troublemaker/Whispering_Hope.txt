3 ContributorsWhispering Hope Lyrics[Verse 1]
Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion, whispers her comforting word
"Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone"

[Chorus]
Whispering hope, oh, how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice

[Verse 2]
If in the dusk of the twilight, dim be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness brighten the glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us, why should the heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over, watch for the breaking of day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hope, as an anchor so steadfast, rends the dark veil for the soul
Whither the Master has entered, robbing the grave of its goal
Come then, O come, glad fruition, come to my sad weary heart
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory, never, O never depart
