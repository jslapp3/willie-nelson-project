4 ContributorsCrazy (Live at Harrah’s Casino, Lake Tahoe, NV - April 1978) Lyrics[Verse]
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
And I’m crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
And I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do?

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m crazy for thinking that my love could hold you

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy for trying, and I'm crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
