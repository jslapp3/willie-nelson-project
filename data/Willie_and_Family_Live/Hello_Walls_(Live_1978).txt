Hello, walls
How'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her
Since she up and walked away?

[Verse 1]
And I'll bet you dread to spend
Another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

[Chorus]
Hello, window
Well, I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely
Since our darling disappeared?

[Verse 2]
Well look here, is that a teardrop
In the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that's it's rain
She went away and left us all alone
The way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along
Without her if we can

Hello, ceiling
I'm going to stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep
So won't you bear with me a while?

[Outro]
We must all stick together
Or else I'll lose my mind
I gotta feeling she'll be gone
A long, long timeEmbed
