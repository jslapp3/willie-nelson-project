3 ContributorsI Can Get Off on You (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus]
Take back the weed and take back the cocaine, baby
Take back the pills and take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now for your love was all I was after
I’ll make it now 'cause I can get off on you

[Verse 1]
And I can get by on little
Or nothing at all, I know
I can get high just
Thinkin' about you and so

[Chorus]
You can take back the weed and take back the cocaine, baby
Take back the pills and take back the whiskey too
I don’t need them now 'cause your love was all I was after
I'll make it now 'cause I can get off on you

[Verse 2]
And who would have thought
This was somethin' that I'd ever do
Bu I'm working it out
And I'm mellowing out on you

[Chorus]
You can take back the weed and take back the cocaine, baby
Take back the pills and take back the whiskey too
I don’t need them now ’cause your love was all I was after
I'll make it now ’cause I can get off on you
I'll make it now 'cause I can get off on youSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
