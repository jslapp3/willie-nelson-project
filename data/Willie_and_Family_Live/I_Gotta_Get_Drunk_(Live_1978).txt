2 ContributorsI Gotta Get Drunk (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus]
Well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
Because I know just what I'm going to do
I'll start to spend my money calling everybody honey
And I'll wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck on some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
Because I know just what I'm going to do

[Verse]
I got to get drunk, I just can't stay sober
There's a lot of good people in town
Who like to see me holler, see me spend my dollar
And I wouldn't dream of letting them down
There's a lot of doctors tell me
That I'd better start slowing it down
But there's more old drunks than there are old doctors
So I guess we'd better have another round

[Chorus]
Well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
Because I know just what I'm going to do
I'll start to spend my money calling everybody honey
And I'll wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck on some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
Because I know just what I'm going to doSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
