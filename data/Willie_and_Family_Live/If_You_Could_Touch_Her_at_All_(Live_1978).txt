3 ContributorsIf You Could Touch Her at All (Live 1978) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Funny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by my bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold

[Chorus]
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all

[Verse 2]
Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes

[Chorus]
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
Sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at allSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
