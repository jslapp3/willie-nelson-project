3 ContributorsIf You’ve Got the Money (I’ve Got the Time) (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus 1]
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonking and we'll have a time
We'll have more fun baby all way down the line

[Verse 1]
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
There ain't no need to tarry let's start out tonight
We'll have fun oh boy oh boy and we'll do it right

[Chorus 2]
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the time

[Verse 2]
We'll go honky tonking make every spot in town
We'll go to the every spot and leave all gold around
If you run short of money I'll run short of time

[Chorus 1]
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonking and we'll have a time
We'll have more fun baby all way down the line

[Chorus 2]
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
