Mr. Record Man I'm looking for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing not someone who went away
Just like me his heart was yearning for a love that used to be
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me
There was something bout a love that didn't treat him right

[Chorus]
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr Record Man get this record for me won't you please
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

[Verse 2]
I was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
And a man that I heard singing sound so blue and all alone
As I listen to his lonely song I wonder could it be
Could there somewhere be another lonely man like me
There was something about a love
That didn't treat him right

[Chorus]
And he'd wake from troubled sleep
And cry her name at night
And Mister Record Man
Get this record for me, won't you please?
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like meSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
