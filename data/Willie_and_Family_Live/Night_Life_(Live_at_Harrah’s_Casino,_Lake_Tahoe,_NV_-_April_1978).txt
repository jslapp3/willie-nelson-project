4 ContributorsNight Life (Live at Harrahâ€™s Casino, Lake Tahoe, NV - April 1978) Lyrics[Verse 1]
And when the evenin' sun goes down
You're gonna find me hangin' 'round
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Verse 2]
And many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be's
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Well now, listen to the blues that they're playin'
And listen to what the blues are sayin'

[Chorus]
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Well now, listen to the blues that they're playin'
And listen to what the blues are sayin'
See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like[Chorus]
Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

[Outro]

Bobbie says hi
This is Jody, Rex, Paul English, Chris, and MickeyEmbed
