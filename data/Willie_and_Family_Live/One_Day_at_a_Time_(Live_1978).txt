3 ContributorsOne Day at a Time (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus]
I live one day at a time I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind and I live one day at a time

[Verse]
I guess that's your surprise to see me back at home
But you know how much I miss you when I'm gone
But don't ask how long I planned to stay it never it crossed my mind
I live one day at a time
See that sparrow fly across the cloudy sky
Searching for a hatch of sunlight so am I
I wish I didn't have to follow and perhaps I want in time
But I live one day at a time

[Chorus]
I live one day at a time I dream one dream at a time
Yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind and I live one day at a timeSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
