3 ContributorsRoll in My Sweet Babyâ€™s Arms (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus]
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms

[Chorus]
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms

[Verse 2]
Now where was you last Saturday night
While I was lyin' in jail?
Walkin' the streets with another man
You wouldn't even go my bail

[Chorus]
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms
