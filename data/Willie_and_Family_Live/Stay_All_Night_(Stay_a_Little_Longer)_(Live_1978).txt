4 ContributorsStay All Night (Stay a Little Longer) (Live 1978) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge's washed out
At the bottom of the hill
Big Creek's up Little Creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel

[Chorus]
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

[Verse 2]
Well you ought to see my Blue Eyed Sally
She lives away down on Shinbone Alley
Number on the gate the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store

[Chorus]
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

[Verse 3]
Now grab your partner and pat her on the head
And if she don't like biscuits feed her cornbread
Girls around big creek about half drawn
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone
You gotta stay all night
See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like[Chorus]
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer
I don't see why you don't stay a little longerEmbed
