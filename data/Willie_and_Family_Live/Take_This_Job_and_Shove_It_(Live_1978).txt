Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I been workin' for
Ya better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walkin', out the door
You can take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more

[Verse 1]
Well, I been working in this factory
For damn near on fifteen years
All this time, I watched my woman
Drownin' in a pool of tears
And I've seen a lot of good folk die
Who had a lot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right off of my back
If I had the guts to say

[Chorus]
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was working for
Ya better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walkin', out the door
You can take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more

The foreman, he's a regular dog
The line boss, he's a fool
He got a flat top haircut
Lord, he thinks he's cool
One of these days, I'm gonna blow my top
And that sucker, he's gonna pay
I can't wait to get the nerve to say

[Chorus]
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was working for
Ya better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walkin', out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Take this job and shove it!Embed
