4 ContributorsTill I Gain Control Again (Live 1978) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin
And I have never gone so long just for telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide a few
You see me better than I can

[Chorus]
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now
'till I gain control again

[Verse 2]
Just like a lighthouse you must stand alone
And mark the sailors journey's end
And no matter what sea that I've been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again

[Chorus]
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now
'till I gain control again
