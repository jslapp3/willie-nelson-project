3 ContributorsWill the Circle Be Unbroken (Live 1978) Lyrics[Chorus]
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

[Verse 1]
I was standing by my window
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

[Chorus]
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

[Verse 2]
I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go

[Chorus]
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the skyEmbed
