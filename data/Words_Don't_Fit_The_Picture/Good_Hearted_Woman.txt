6 ContributorsGood Hearted Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
Is not what she's living to day
But she never complains of
The bad times or bad things he's done
She's just talks about the good times
They've had and all the good times to come

[Chorus]
She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman
In love with her good timin' man

[Verse 2]
Now he likes the night life
The bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over
She welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him
She does the best that she can
This good hearted woman
In love with her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman
In love with her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understandEmbed
