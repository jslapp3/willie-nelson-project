2 ContributorsIf You Really Loved Me Lyrics[Verse]
If you really loved me
You wouldn't treat me this way
And you'd be kind enough
To leave some life while I'm away
And I might cry when you go
But I won't die when you go
And someday someone just might come along
If you really loved me
You wouldn't test me this way
You wouldn't leave the choice of leaving up to me
But I'm too proud to survive
Because I'm more dead than alive
Because someday someone just might come alongSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
