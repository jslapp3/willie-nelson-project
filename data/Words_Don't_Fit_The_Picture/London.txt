2 ContributorsLondon Lyrics[Verse]
The streets are dark and quiet at London, after midnight
Listen
The silence is the master of darkness, and London can sleep tonight
Protected by the master
London... London
You scream the largest portion of the day
London... London
Rest your lungs, tomorrow's on its waySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
