My heart takes walks with her on cold and rainy days
She leads my heart along where only love can lead the way
And I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
She makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl
She makes to proud to walk the streets of anywhere
And if our bed be grass or cotton she won't care
And I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
She makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl

[Outro][x2]
And I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
She makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girlSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
