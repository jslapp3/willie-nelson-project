5 ContributorsRainy Day Blues Lyrics[Verse]
Well it's cloudy in the morning going to be raining in the afternoon
Cloudy in the morning and it's going to be raining in the afternoon
If you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move
But if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
If you're running from it brother the only road that I can see [x2]
Is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me

[Chorus]
Rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather
Guess I'll never see the sun again

[Bridge]
Save those dimes and nickels save them for a rainy day
Save your dimes and nickels save them for a rainy day
It ain't going to keep the rain from coming
But at least you know you've paid your way

[Chorus]
Rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather
Guess I'll never see the sun againSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
