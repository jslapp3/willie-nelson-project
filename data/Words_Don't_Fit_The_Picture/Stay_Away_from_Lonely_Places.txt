Stay away from lonely places
Just follow the crowd
And stay around familiar faces
Play the music loud
Be seen at all the parties
And dress yourself with style
And stay away from lonely places for awhile

[Verse 2]
Stay away from lonely places
'Til you learn to live alone
And someone's outstretched arms are waiting
To stay with you at least 'til dawn
And remember that sorrow prospers
In a heart that never smiles
So stay away from lonely places for awhile

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Stay away from lonely places
It takes time to learn to live alone
And someone's outstretched arms are waiting
To stay with you at least 'til dawn
And remember that sorrow prospers
In a heart that never smiles
So stay away from lonely places for awhileSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
