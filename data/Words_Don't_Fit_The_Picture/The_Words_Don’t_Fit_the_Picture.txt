4 ContributorsThe Words Donâ€™t Fit the Picture Lyrics[Verse]
If this is a game we play
And if this is a role I play
Where are the words, I say to you
The words don't fit the picture anymore

And if we've been acting all along
And we both act right and we both act wrong
Where does it say that we should cry
It's just the words don't fit the picture anymore, anymore

The words don't fit the picture anymore
No need to force the love scenes anymore
And a one act play comes to an end
And we turn to leave, we can both part friends
But this is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
Because the words don't fit the picture anymore, anymoreSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
