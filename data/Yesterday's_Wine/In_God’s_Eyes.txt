6 ContributorsIn Godâ€™s Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never think evil thoughts of anyone
It's just as wrong to think as to say
For a thought I, but a word that's unspoken
In God's eyes, he sees it this way
Lend a hand if you can to a stranger
Never worry if he can't repay
For in time you'll be repaid ten times over
In God's eyes, he sees it this way

[Chorus]
In God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow
Now and then a lamb goes astray
But open arms should awake it's returning
In God's eyes, he sees it this way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
In God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow
Now and then a lamb goes astray
But open arms should awake it's returning
In God's eyes, he sees it this way
In God's eyes, he sees it this waySee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
