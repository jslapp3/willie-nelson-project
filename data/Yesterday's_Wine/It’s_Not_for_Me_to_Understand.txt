4 ContributorsItâ€™s Not for Me to Understand Lyrics[Verse]
I passed a home the other day
The yard was filled with kids at play
And on the sidewalk of this home
A little boy stood all alone
His smiling face was sweet and kind
But I could see the boy was blind
He listened to the children play
I bowed my head and there I prayed
Dear Lord above why must this be?
And then these words came down to me
After all you're just a man
And it's not for you to understand
It's not for you to reason why
You too are blind without my eyes
So question not what I command
'Cause it's not for you to understand
Now when I pray my prayer is one
I pray his will, not mine, be done
After all I'm just a man
And it's not for me to understandSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
