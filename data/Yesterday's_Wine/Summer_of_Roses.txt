8 ContributorsSummer of Roses Lyrics[Verse 1]
A short time I have to be with you, my love
But a short time is better than no time, you see
So I bring to you all my possessions
And would let you share them with me

[Verse 2]
I bring you one springtime of robins
One springtime of robins to sing
I bring you one summer of roses
One summer of roses I bring

[Verse 3]
I bring you one autumn dry leaves
Dry leaves will be helpful, you know
To soften the fall of your snowflakes
When I bring you your winter of snowSee Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
