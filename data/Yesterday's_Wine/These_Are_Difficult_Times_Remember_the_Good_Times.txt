4 ContributorsThese Are Difficult Times/Remember the Good Times Lyrics[Verse]
These are difficult times
These are difficult times
Lord, please give me a sign
For these are difficult times
Remember the good times
They're smaller in number, and easier to recall
Don't spend too much time on the bad times
Their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
Don't waste a moment unhappy
Invaluable moments, gone with the leakage of time
As we leave on our own separate journeys
Moving west with the sun to a place buried deep within our minds
And remember the good times
They're smaller in number, and easier to recall
Don't spend too much time on the bad times
Their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
Remember the good times
They're smaller in number, and easier to recall
Don't spend too much time on the bad times
Their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind...See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
