4 ContributorsWhereâ€™s the Show/Let Me Be a Man LyricsExplain again to me Lord when I'm here
I don't know, I don't know
The setting for the stage is still not clear
Where's the show, where's the show?
Let it begin, let it begin, I'm born, can you use me?

What would you have me to do Lord
Shall I sing them a song?
I could tell them all about you, Lord
I could write of the loves I have known

I'll work in their cotton and cornfields
I promise to do all I can
I'll laugh and I'll cry
I'll live and I'll die
Please, Lord, let me be a man

Dear Lord, let me be a man
And I'll give it all that I can
If I'm needed in this distant land
Please, Lord, let me be a man

Before I begin this level of journeying
Portraying most typical man
Last minute instructions
Would surely be welcome
Please, Lord, let me hold to your hand
