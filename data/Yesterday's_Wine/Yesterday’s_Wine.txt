Miracles appear
In the strangest of places
Fancy meeting you here
The last time I saw you
Was just out of Houston
Sit down let me buy you a beer
Your presence is welcome
With me and my friend here
This is a hangout of mine
We come here quite often
And listen to music
Partaking of yesterday's wine

[Chorus]
Yesterday's wine
I'm yesterday's wine
Ageing with time
Like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine
We're yesterday's wine
Ageing with time
Like yesterday's wine

[Verse 2]
You give the appearance
Of one widely travelled
I'll bet you've seen
Things in your time
So sit down beside me
And tell me your story
If you think you're like yesterday's wine

Yesterday's wine
We're yesterday's wine
Ageing with time
Like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine
We're yesterday's wine
Ageing with time
Like yesterday's wineEmbed
